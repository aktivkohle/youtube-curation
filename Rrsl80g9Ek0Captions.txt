Good morning. Thank you so much for being here
and for taking time out of your day to come and see me, and
hopefully what I&#39;m going to say will help you in some manner. I&#39;m Sally Flaherty. You have to have that little
&quot;lilt&quot; in it, because it&#39;s a grand Irish name. And I work for the
Department of Education. And, yes, I work for
the Department of Ed. Okay? Sometimes it&#39;s not a ride for
the squeamish, but it is such a great ride. It is good to be able to help
students, and I know you don&#39;t think about that very often,
that people in PDE are here to help students, but I work in the
curriculum department, and I can talk for the curriculum
department, and that is what we do every day. We are here to help you, the
professionals in the field, do your jobs to
help students succeed. They hired me as the Social
Studies advisor, all right? Because Social Studies is a
second session for me, because when I graduated from high
school, you know, back with John Dewey, they told me that I
was not allowed to be a Social Studies teacher
because I couldn&#39;t coach. And I believed them. So, I said, &quot;Well, okay.&quot; So, my sister was a speech
pathologist, and I figured if she could do it,
I could do it. Right? So, I&#39;m a certified speech and
language pathologist, and still have kept up with my
certifications on that. But I concentrated on
language for learning. How does a child
need language to learn? Which got me into learning,
because, as educators, we&#39;re in the business of learning, and we
had to do a lot of interest in how a child learns. Because, just because I teach a
dog to whistle doesn&#39;t mean he can whistle, because he
can&#39;t have the capacity. I&#39;ve tried. It just doesn&#39;t work, but
maybe it was because it was a Chihuahua. I don&#39;t know. So, but I went back to school,
because apparently going to school is what I do best. And, I got my Social Studies
degree, and I am now the content advisor for Social Studies. So, in the meantime, I got a
curriculum degree, and I got my administration degree, and
I was working with behavior. I&#39;m this close
to getting my BCBA. It&#39;s been a convoluted road. We always called it
&quot;resume building.&quot; I worked at a small IU in the
west, and anybody here, as you know, and as you are all doing
right now, you wear many hats. Don&#39;t you? And, how many times during the
day do you have to switch, and you say, &quot;Okay. Am I the PIMS coordinator
now, or am I the data person?&quot; You get it. Don&#39;t be worried about that. That&#39;s called
resume building. Okay? And you will have a resume when
you&#39;re done as long as your arm, and you will be qualified to do
so many things, because you have actual experience. So, that actual experience in
resume building got me into being asked to do the Educator
Dashboard Early Warning System Intervention Resource Catalog. We always have
long names at PDE. So, that&#39;s what I also do. I&#39;m not only just the
Social Studies advisor. I&#39;m also the program manager
for the Early Warning System Intervention Catalog,
otherwise known as the Dashboard. Which brings us to data, which
brings us to the implementation phase of what I&#39;ve seen when I&#39;m
out in the districts, because I actually do go to districts. And I have been to some of your
districts, and we will come and visit you if we are invited. We are not police. They have not given me a badge. I want a badge. There are some
days I want a badge. They won&#39;t give me a badge,
but we are here to help you. If you invite us to come, we
will be there to help you. And we are the ones who
do the research for you. You don&#39;t have
time to do research. So, if you say to me, &quot;What
do I need to do for this?&quot; I&#39;ll say, &quot;Well, this is what
the research says,&quot; or, &quot;I&#39;ll get back to you after
I do some research.&quot; Use me. It&#39;s good. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done here. In the implementation phase for
using data, the one thing I have found that is an area of
difficulty for leaders is how do you put data center stage
in a school culture that is not about data? The rest of our lives are
filled with real-time data. I get into my car, and I turn
on the ignition, and it gives me real-time information
about my oil life, my gas. Even when I&#39;m driving, it tells
me if I&#39;m driving efficiently for fuel economy. Okay? That&#39;s real-time data. I wear an Apple watch, so I
have real-time data on if I am, indeed, having enough active
calories during the day, so I can stay fit and get
out of the decade of death. Which, when we were 30, that was
funny, but now that I&#39;m in the decade, it&#39;s not so much. But I use data. I thought I was active before,
but once I got this, it&#39;s like, I&#39;m like a couch potato. And I find myself at night,
it&#39;s like, &quot;I only have 100 more steps to reach my goal and get
my badge,&quot; and I get up and I walk around my apartment. I mean, it&#39;s about
getting the badge. Right? But it&#39;s real-time data. You live by real-time data. We are healthier now as
a nation, because we have real-time data. Is our educational system
healthy, and how do we know? We have to look at the data, but
there&#39;s so much data out there. You guys are collecting data
all the time, all the time. What do we do with it? Do you get data off your
[inaudible] to help students, or is it more of a report at the
end of the year of, &quot;You know, we didn&#39;t do so well in
February, and it&#39;s June.&quot; Those are quarterly reports, you
know, how we do as a nation in our economic downturn for
the first quarter, etcetera. Real-time data. It&#39;s a new concept for
education, because our educators love students. That&#39;s why they
went into education. They did not go into education
for June, July, and August, and they did not go in for the pay. Maybe for the retirement
benefits, but, you know. No. Why did they become educators? Let&#39;s think about it. So, let&#39;s give them the tools
they need to fulfill what they want to do, and help
them do their jobs easier. Because loving and being
concerned about the students is one thing. Having action to put that love
and concern into play, to help a child, is another. So, as I&#39;m out there in
districts, it is the leader, and the leader has to remember this. I love Abigail Adams. Dated John for a while,
until she found out. I mean, I spent hours with him
on TV, and then I read the book. And when you spend that many
hours in a book getting to know a person, it&#39;s like
you&#39;ve dated them. Right? So, Abigail said that learning
must be sought with ardor and attended to with diligence. Practice makes permanent. We have to remember this. I have this on my cubicle wall
because it is about diligence and ardor, and
happily pursuing a topic. You&#39;re in this room
because you are a leader. You have been chosen to
represent your district at this conference. It was not just,
&quot;Well, somebody&#39;s got to go. Let&#39;s flip a coin,&quot;
unless that was yours. Was that your reason to come? You lost the toss? All right. You&#39;re the leaders,
for whatever reason. Whether in title or whether in
character, you are the leader. And, as the leader, and if you
are going to be in charge of moving data and getting your
educators to use data, these are the steps you must do. Now, this is going to be basic,
very, very basic, to get you started. People don&#39;t think like you,
believe it or not, because if they thought like you,
then your job would be really easy. Right? You wouldn&#39;t have to correct the
accuracy of the data that you put in. Right? That&#39;s why you&#39;re
in that position, or your administrators. We have any administrators here? Yes. Okay? If they all thought like you,
your job would be really easy. Wouldn&#39;t it? All right. So, this presentation is about
using the research that has been done before, that
says the wheel is round. You don&#39;t have to reinvent it. Let&#39;s look at what you need to
do as a leader to start moving data center
stage in your school. All of this is for you, the
leader, and I can get you a badge that says, &quot;The leader,&quot;
if you want, or make yourself one, a Post-It note that says,
&quot;The leader,&quot; because that&#39;s exactly what you are. Start small. I want to change the world,
but, when you look at it, and I change the world of one child,
I&#39;ve changed their world. Think small. Begin with core issues that have
validity, that have impact, that have a sense of,
I don&#39;t want to say urgency. This is urgency,
but not an emergency. Start small. Begin with a core issue. And this is a piece -
provide a positive climate. Educators are out there who
think that data is used as a gotcha. They think that, because of
student performance, you&#39;re going to come in and tell
me I&#39;m not doing my job. If that&#39;s why you&#39;re using data,
stop, because that&#39;s not the use of data. The use of data is to help
students succeed, not if the teacher is doing
their job. Okay? The data tells how a student is
doing, and how we as adults can change our work, to change our
actions, to help the child. Okay? So, always
provide a positive climate. Disney, happiest place on Earth. Right? Have you been there? Yes. It&#39;s about happy for the first
day, and then it&#39;s like, &quot;I can&#39;t believe all
these people are here.&quot; So, happiest place on Earth. Do you know what the ratio
is of positives to negatives? 70 to 1. 70 to 1. For every negative experience,
you have to have 70 positives, because that&#39;s
the tipping point. You forget about the negative,
because you have all of these positives. 70. Now, in your school climate,
are you providing 70 positive moments to the
one negative? Yes. It&#39;s not easy, but that&#39;s what
it takes to change that climate, to be positive. You have to change your attitude
and your wording to look at a positive side of it. So, when we had a child that
screamed, and that&#39;s what he did most of the day,
what&#39;s the positive in that? He had great lung capacity. All right? You have to start looking at the
positives, and you do that as an exercise. What&#39;s the
positive of this? Right? You are now the leader and
the teacher for your staff. Your staff are your students. Provide for
them many opportunities, learning opportunities. Help it be formative. If you have to say, &quot;How
many times do I have to tell these people?&quot; Well, guess what the answer is. Obviously one more. I mean, really. So, for every time you stand
there and you say, &quot;I&#39;ve told them, and I&#39;ve told
them, and I&#39;ve told them. I&#39;ve told them
about data accuracy. I&#39;ve told them about
putting this in the grade book. I&#39;ve told them. I&#39;ve told them. How many times do I
have to tell them?&quot; Guess what? Obviously one more, because
they&#39;re not getting it. Provide learning opportunities. Actions that are
reinforced will continue. Actions that are
reinforced positively will be continued. Right? But, above all, be the
leader, and be patient. You&#39;re changing the world. It doesn&#39;t happen overnight. Talk to Nelson Mandela. Dated him for
a while, too. Okay? I mean, that man was patient. How many years did he spend in
prison, before he could change the world? Can you be no less? You&#39;re changing the world. Be patient. Where do you begin? These are the questions
we&#39;re going to examine. Basically, it&#39;s like, what
do you want to examine? You have got to be specific. You have got to spend time
sorting it through and seeing what you want. Now, this is all done...you&#39;re
doing this in your car, in your racquetball session, in your
job, in your office, if you&#39;re in the cafeteria pretending
that you&#39;re watching people. Okay. What do you
want to examine? Are you collecting
that data already? So, you better talk to your
data people to know what you&#39;re collecting. All right? I had one school that had no
idea how many assessments they gave in the school. So, we had to do an inventory. They couldn&#39;t believe how many
assessments were going on in their school on a daily basis. So they really did begin to
know then about too much testing time. Okay? What are you collecting? What is the process to
provide you that data? I may want to know what my
target heart rate is and how many minutes I am in the zone,
but can I get that information? How easy is it to get? How difficult is it to get? And do you already collect it? Who will examine that data? So, once you get it, and you get
your focus, who do you want to look at it? But, above all, are
they data literate? We can assume they know, but I&#39;m
telling you, elementary school, elementary school teachers,
and you look at the graduate programs for getting a degree in
elementary education, do any of them require higher level
math for graduation to get a Master&#39;s degree? So, the last time an elementary
teacher had any kind of math course was when? Audience: [Inaudible] Yes. You have to think. Was it their freshman
year in college? Maybe. But some can get through by
having 10th grade geometry. Now, I&#39;m not casting aspersions
among elementary educators, because they spend a lot of time
in their field understanding child development and growth and
learning, etcetera, etcetera. Math has not been one
of the things they do. Data literacy has not
been in the forefront of their education. So, are they data literate? And, if they aren&#39;t, what
are we going to do about it? Okay? Then, we
have to look at the time. When are we going
to examine this data? When in my school day
am I going to do this? And, is anything going to
be done with what we found? I had one school that did not
want the Educator Dashboard, because they did not want to
know how many kids were at risk, because they
couldn&#39;t deal with it. That works. Sure. All right.
Be ready to do something. So, we&#39;re going to look at the
research from Dr. Robert Balfanz out of Johns Hopkins. And, he has done extensive
research on children at risk for disengaging in
their educational path. We&#39;ve known them
as dropouts. Okay? But we know now, as early at
5th grade, who is at risk for dropping out. We even know, with the data, of
who is at risk in kindergarten by looking at the attendance
data in kindergarten. Do you know why? What five year old gets up and
gets dressed and comes to school on their own? I know you all did. Sure, because you&#39;re
dedicated lifelong learners. How many of our kids do that? So, we get to look at the
attendance factors in elementary school, because that shows you
the culture and the value of education in the family and
the community in which they are growing. Balfanz discovered that the
ABC&#39;s are attendance, behavior, and course grades. They are not separate. They are intertwined. You have to look at them,
but these are the vitals of a healthy educational system. We all have vitals, and when we
go to the doctor, that they have learned your temperature, your
heart rate, your blood pressure are your vitals. Because if anything is going on
in your body that is amiss, it&#39;s going to manifest
itself in your vitals. Correct? These are the vitals for
education, attendance, behavior, and course grades. This shows you how healthy
your educational system is. So, this is the data you&#39;re
going to want to look at first. Are you collecting this data? If the student is not in
school, how can they learn? But if they&#39;re not learning, why
do they want to come to school? Which comes first? We have a lot of students,
and you have to understand human nature. Human nature would rather
look bad than stupid. Okay? And our kids are at that point. They learn very, very early that
they would rather be bad and be known as a bad guy, or a
goof-off, or a comedian, than, &quot;I can&#39;t read,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t
do the math,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t sit still.&quot; All right? So, which comes first? They want to come to school, but
they don&#39;t want to look stupid so they act out. So, they become
acting out individuals. The data is
speaking for the child. The child is not going to come
to school and tell you, &quot;Oh, you know, I feel like I&#39;m not
successful at any part of the school day. And so, therefore, if I act out,
I can spend most of my day in the principal&#39;s office. And then, I don&#39;t have to deal
with Mrs. Flaherty&#39;s Social Studies class.&quot; The kid is not
going to tell you that. That&#39;s way too sophisticated. But when he suddenly
acts out the period before Mrs. Flaherty&#39;s Social Studies
class, and he does it every day for two weeks,
what&#39;s the data tell you? That there&#39;s something
about 10:00 o&#39;clock. You know? So, these are our vitals. Make sure you look at this, look
at your data, see that you&#39;re collecting this, and how deeply
the data you want to go, because this is what&#39;s
going to tell you. Now, in our Educator Dashboard,
this is what we monitor, and this is what is displayed
in red, green, or yellow. Very, very easy. So, therefore, when you have
data literacy issues, make the data representation as easy as
possible, because everybody gets red means danger, Will Robinson. Green means we&#39;re good to go. Yellow means we
can go either way. We have a downward trend. Okay? So, look at your data, and see
how well you can represent it. So, now, are you
collecting that? Are you collecting that data? Look at what
you&#39;ve already got going. Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Talk about what you&#39;ve got,
and inventory those data points collected. So, if we have Jack, who doesn&#39;t
want to come to Mrs. Flaherty&#39;s Social Studies class,
do we collect that data? How do we do that? Who does that? Is it a clerk? You get the idea? If I want to know how many
half-days we have, do we collect half-day absences, or do
we just collect full days? I know this is logical, but it&#39;s
like, if it&#39;s in the PowerPoint, then you can say I&#39;ve
got to look at it. All right? But, also, you have
to look at the fidelity. How accurate is it? Are the teachers uploading this
information daily, or are they recalling it on Friday afternoon
before they leave, because they have to submit their reports
before they can go home for the weekend? So, how valid is it? We had one school that had
tardies, that everybody that was tardy was treated equally,
whether they were tardy for two minutes, or whether they were
tardy for two and a half hours. They&#39;re all equal,
because tardy is tardy. How valid is that? A student who is never, ever
tardy, and then all of a sudden is tardy three days in
one week, what&#39;s going on? Yes. Mom had a cold. &quot;I took Nyquil,
and I didn&#39;t wake up. It wasn&#39;t his fault he was late. It was because I was incapable
of driving at the time.&quot; Okay? But guess who had
to serve detention? The boy who was late. So, at that point in time, I
was trying to teach this middle school child, my son,
about responsibility. Accept responsibility. If you did it,
there are consequences for your responsibilities. You&#39;ve all had that talk. Right? So, he says to me, &quot;So, fine. You overslept, and now I
have to serve detention.&quot; I said, &quot;No. I&#39;ll serve detention with you.&quot; So, I went in, and
I served detention. Oh, he was so embarrassed, but
I sat in the office after school and did my work. So, we&#39;re
talking about validity. We&#39;re talking about equity. We&#39;re talking about looking
at the fidelity of your data. Now, all of this is being done
before you do anything else. This is still for you,
the leader, to do. When you look at...
Can you see David Ronka? It&#39;s not Fobb. It&#39;s Robb Geier
and Mr. Marciniak. Those are leaders. Especially when you want to
Google any information on data use in schools,
Google Geier. Okay? They have to look at these
critical factors for data use. Is it accurate? Is it organized? Do we have multiple measures? How valid is it? Is it relevant? Can we disaggregate it? Are we looking at, when we say
we have 50% absences on Fridays, what else do you
need to know about that? This is how to disaggregate it. Is it just the basketball
team that&#39;s absent on Fridays? Is it sports teams? Is it clubs? Is it kids that have the flu? Do we have an epidemic going on? You see, you have to
disaggregate that to get down to core issues. Believe it or not, people
do not know how to do that. That comes easy for you, but
other people do not know how to rip those layers
into usable information. So, help them, and give
them ways to disaggregate. You have to look at the
capacity of your culture, of your district, of your
school, of your classroom. You have to have this culture. Now, you&#39;re moving to change the
world of your district, to move to be data. You have to have commitment. Now, what does commitment mean? That means doing it for
more than three weeks. Okay? The commitment means you decide
what it&#39;s going to be, so when you roll it out in August, it&#39;s
the same message in October and December and
February and March through May. Commitment. So many times in education,
we have had things change. It will go away. &quot;Oh, yes. That&#39;s the new thing. It will go away. Yes. Oh, I remember that. It was called this before. Oh, yes. RTII. MTSS. RTI. Multiple systems [inaudible].&quot; It&#39;s all the same thing. It&#39;s helping students, but
people keep hearing it over and over again
under different names. They think it&#39;s something new. So, articulate that vision. Be specific. What is the vision for
your district for data use? Get whoever you want in to
help you craft that vision, but get it. Write it down. Articulate it, and share it. And don&#39;t change it. The vision in August is still
the vision in October, which is still the vision in March, which
is still the vision in May. So, you do all of this before
you ever begin to move your team. Okay? This keeps you on point. This is your compass. Keep referring to it. Publish it. Put it on the walls. It&#39;s your guiding compass. They&#39;re going to push back,
because they don&#39;t like change, but keep the vision. So, you have to
have that vision. As the leader, that&#39;s yours. What happens if they
don&#39;t follow the vision? Not that teachers would ever do
that, not that they&#39;re passive aggressive like my family. &quot;Oh, well, we just won&#39;t talk
about it, and it will go away.&quot; Okay? Or, &quot;I&#39;m just going
to keep doing what I&#39;m doing. If they want me to change,
they&#39;ll tell me, because I&#39;m special, and they want to tell
me, personally, that they mean it.&quot; Okay? Think about when you&#39;re
disciplining a kid, and you&#39;ve been in a classroom. And I&#39;ve seen in an early
intervention classroom where they went...the teacher is at
the desk, and this three year old is just
running, running, running. And, the teacher is
going, &quot;Quit running. I mean it. Quit running. No more. You walk. Quit running. One more time. I mean it. Don&#39;t make me get up.&quot; I mean, it&#39;s like,
which time did you mean it? Which time did you mean it? The one where the voice got
louder and higher, and she rose from her desk? That&#39;s when she meant it. Teachers have to know, and your
education and your staff has to know, what&#39;s the accountability
piece, and can you enforce it? Positives. Positives. 70 positives. Don&#39;t be punitive. Be positive. All those teachers that get
their reports in on time do not have to stay on Friday afternoon
to get them in before they can go home and have a
nice tall cold one. Start pointing these
things out to them. &quot;You know, you could do it
later, but that&#39;s your choice.&quot; Start looking at the positives. Everybody that gets their
reports in on time or does this or looks at this, then look
at how this is going to help a child. Keep going back to the vision
of we are helping a child. We&#39;re not doing this because I
think you don&#39;t have anything to do on Friday afternoon. Right? You&#39;re doing this because this
thing that you&#39;re doing is going to help this child. We have a school over at Albert
Gallatin School District. Are you familiar with Albert
Gallatin, down in the southwest of the state? If you use your left hand as
Pennsylvania, they&#39;re down here. [Inaudible]
is up here. Got that? I know. Everybody is
looking at their hand now. All right. Down here. They have used the data from
the Early Warning System for two years now, and, because of their
proactive way of accountability and collaboration and modeling,
they have kept 26 children out of the AEDY [Alternative
Education for Disruptive Youth] program. Twenty-six students
are with their peers. They are in their district. They are not being
shipped out to another place. Twenty-six lives were changed
because they used data. Now, that is a
success story in itself. So, when you celebrate those
successes, accountability just starts going through the roof. People want to use it. People want to do it. But, above all, you model. You model. You model your actions, your
words, how you do a meeting. If you want to be data
centered, then start every meeting with data. Walk the talk. Expect them to come with data. We have schools that have data,
that when they come in for their faculty meeting, the first 10
minutes is spent on the top 10 children at risk, based on
your assessment on such and such a day. It&#39;s no more pleasantries of,
&quot;You know, the vending machine isn&#39;t working in
the faculty room. My room is too cold.&quot; Right? &quot;These kids are always late. They don&#39;t bring their books.&quot; Have you heard it? You hear the noise. Let&#39;s start
looking at the signal. So, the leader is
there focusing them. You&#39;re modeling. You&#39;re talking. You are accountable, and you
have the vision, and this is single handed. How do you think Disney does it? They&#39;re focused. They model. They want you to believe this is
the happiest place on Earth, and it is, so do it. Data is important. Don&#39;t put it at the
end of the meeting. Don&#39;t bring it up at the
end of the in-service. In fact, if you know when
your in-services are...which everybody does, right? Figure out, for the next year,
these are your lesson plans because these are your students. What do you want them to do in
these in-services that moves you to this vision? Okay? Model. You don&#39;t know how many times I
get phone calls, because, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve got an in-service next
week, and I&#39;ve got an hour I don&#39;t know what to do with. Can you come in and
talk about something?&quot; Sure. That fits into the lesson plan. Doesn&#39;t it? All right. Okay. What is the process to provide
the data for examination? If the printout for your data is
in size 5 font, with 55 columns, on a legal size paper, and my
data wizard has to stay and aggregate that for 12 hours, is
that something you&#39;re going to want to do? That&#39;s your choice. That&#39;s your
choice to answer that. But if you&#39;re going to start
small, yes, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do that. All right? Look at what you&#39;ve already
got in place for your student information systems. Many, many student information
systems are good, and they do work. We have some, I know MMS has a
great thing that&#39;s going on to aggregate their data
and present it visually. PowerSchool is doing some things
to present their data visually, but you have to
do that analysis. Okay? But they are doing
a lot with colors. Colors are easy. I love to look at colors. Again, red means not so good. Green means we&#39;re doing good. And then, that way, you spend
time not analyzing the data, but in the discussion for why
the data looks that way. Okay? Can&#39;t go over how much
easy to read is so important. So, now you&#39;ve decided. You have your vision. It is articulated. You have it. You know it. You say it in your sleep. You do it in the commute in
the car on the way there. You are ready to go. It is published. It supports the vision
statement of the school, etcetera, etcetera. Now, who&#39;s going to look at it? Who do you want on your team? Don&#39;t start with everybody. It doesn&#39;t work. In all organizations, you&#39;ve got
about 20% of people - about 20% of people who are going
to jump on board with you. They&#39;re your go-getters. They&#39;re the ones
that will embrace change. They&#39;re the ones that have
different lessons every year. They don&#39;t laminate
the lesson plans. You know? They don&#39;t put the lesson
plans in Sharpie, and then laminate them. You know the people I mean. You&#39;ve got your 20%, and you&#39;ve
got to watch there though, because some people are the
ones that will just jump on the bandwagon to be on the
bandwagon, and not have sustainability to make it work. And, everybody&#39;s
going to say, &quot;Oh, yes. You know Sally. She jumps on the next thing. You know? She buys every fad there is.&quot; Yes. I still have a pet rock. It&#39;s still alive, too. So, you have to look at that. Look for the people that are
going to support the vision. You&#39;ve got 20% of them. Now, you&#39;ve got your bottom 20%
that are so engrained in the culture of what they do, being
the kings and queens of their domain, because
they&#39;ve seen it come. They&#39;ve seen it go. Or, you have newbies that
just don&#39;t know how to change, because, &quot;I&#39;m so new. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m just trying to
survive every day. Don&#39;t ask me to change.&quot; They&#39;re included in
your 20% at the bottom. Okay? Because they&#39;re so overwhelmed
they don&#39;t know what else to do. So, you&#39;ve got this
60% in the middle. There&#39;s your fodder. These are the ones
you want to change. These are the ones that you want
to support, because you get them to the tipping point,
and you&#39;re going to get over. So, pick your
teams from the top 20%. Pick your teams, have people
from the middle, that they&#39;re on the fence people, and pick one
person from your bottom 20%, because they&#39;re going
to keep you anchored. Okay? Because, if you can change that
one from the bottom 20%, you&#39;re on your way, but if you aren&#39;t,
then you have to change your plan, because the data is
telling you it&#39;s not working. Right? You see what I mean? So, if you want a valid...a
working group, look at your... look at your information. Look at your demographics. Ask for volunteers. You know the ones you can go
to, and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m thinking about doing this. I&#39;d like you,
Tim, to come with me. Do you think you&#39;re up to it? Do you have time in your
schedule, in your commitment, to help this?&quot; Ask them, because you don&#39;t want
somebody who&#39;s going to give you part time for a culture change. Because you know what? They have to have commitment
and accountability, because they become leaders as well. Right? Am I telling you anything new? You know this, but it&#39;s nice to
hear somebody validate it for you. Right? Okay. There&#39;s also a good book out
there called Switch, by Chip and Dan Heath. If you have not read it, put it
in your library, or check out the website. It gives you pretty much what&#39;s
in the book, and it&#39;s about changing in a culture that
doesn&#39;t want to change. Very easy reading. I get it on audio books. So, it helps when I&#39;m biking. Okay? So, do that. That&#39;s going to help you. But, now, with your core
team, you&#39;re going to provide professional
development for them. Build capacity. Just because they&#39;re an
educator got them the job. Now, let&#39;s give them the tools
they need to do the job well. Make sure your
administration is on board. Talk to them before you
even issue one invitation. Start to them about your vision. Get your
administration on board. Who else do you need
to be on your team? Here&#39;s your qualifiers. Critical, has responsibility,
has responsibility in the response for the results. Notice there&#39;s no
job titles there. I&#39;m not saying,
&quot;Get your counselor. Get your senior high
Social Studies teacher.&quot; Get the people who are critical
to help you do that, and it&#39;s not by job title. It could be,
but usually it&#39;s not. Who does what? Now, we want you to
look at this, using data to improve schools. And, we have here, from REL,
a wonderful document called Toolkit for a Workshop on
Building a Culture of Data Use. You can download it. I&#39;ll show you where all the
files are to get all this information, but here it is. it&#39;s right here, ready to go. They give you recommendations. They give you a slideshow. They give you modules. Hey, the wheel is round. Let&#39;s use it. Okay? So, introducing
the culture of data. It&#39;s here. If you want help
with it, REL is here. REL will help you. I will help you. The Department
will help you. Okay? So, like I said, it&#39;s a toolkit. It&#39;s ready to go, but you must
have an executive champion that sanctions it. That says, &quot;Go.&quot; And, it&#39;s kind of like they
coronate you and they bless you, that you are the leader, because
otherwise you&#39;re a loose cannon. Here&#39;s what we want the
superintendent to do. You have to give them
expectations, because these people are CEO&#39;s. They have a lot of stuff to do. There&#39;s many things
that...they&#39;re managers, they&#39;re labor advocates, they are
negotiators, etcetera, etcetera, but they will meet you, if
you give them, &quot;This is what I expect of you.&quot; And, most times,
they&#39;ll meet you on it. And, if they don&#39;t, then you
know what you&#39;re dealing with. Get your school board on
board, because, you know why? Pennsylvania is a
locally controlled system. You know what that means? It&#39;s a local decision. How many times have you called
PDE, and they say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s a local decision,&quot; and you think
it&#39;s because we don&#39;t want to tell you. We can&#39;t tell you. I have people that want me to
give them a scope and sequence for Social Studies, from
kindergarten to 12th grade. I can&#39;t. I can give you recommendations. I can give you examples, but if
I give you a scope and sequence, then it becomes a state required
scope and sequence, and it&#39;s a local decision. That gives you great latitude. It is a local choice, based on
the culture of your community, what decisions you make for
the education of your students. Get your school
board on board. Okay? Relate to them, because most of
your community members that are on board use real-time data. And, your school board people
use data for their sales, their businessmen in the community,
their business women. They live in a data world, even
though they may not know it, and they may think the schools work
that way, too, because they don&#39;t know what
they don&#39;t know. Right? Get them on board as your
allies, because they&#39;re going to be the ones that are going
to give you time allocation. They&#39;re going to be the ones
that will give you funds. They&#39;re going to give you the
ones that give you the go ahead to say, &quot;This is
important.&quot; Okay. We&#39;re good with this so far? All of this is done
before you even have a meeting. You&#39;re sharpening your axe. Abraham Lincoln, who took me
to the prom, all right, he said that if he had to chop down a
tree, he would spend nine hours sharpening his axe, and the
rest of the time cutting down the tree. Prepare, prepare, prepare. So, at this time, now
you have a team leader. Now, maybe you&#39;re going to
assign somebody else to be the team leader. You have a cultural
leader, the team leader. Maybe it&#39;s you, but leaders
need to know exactly what their responsibilities are. And, guess what? Some people do not know that the
leader sets the meeting times. Yes. It&#39;s like, I know. You think, well, they know that. But if they knew
that, they would do it. But, when it&#39;s written down,
then you can say, &quot;Well, remember, you&#39;re supposed
to set the meetings times.&quot; Okay? They set the agenda. They establish the norms and the
protocol, just as I said that the faculty meetings
start with data now. The team leader does that. And, of course, you are
providing that safe atmosphere for discussion. And that takes an active leader. I have one school. It&#39;s a very small school that I
know of, that their SAP [Student Assistance Program] team is
a gossip session, because everybody knows everybody else. And, it turns into, &quot;Oh, well,
do you know that she did? And they did this. And now, what&#39;s the
kid going to do?&quot; No. That has nothing to do with the
facts at hand, and it was up to the team leader to stop it
and create a professional atmosphere, and not
a gossip session. Okay? Deliberate action, hard work,
determination produce an effective team. That sounds like
the American way. Doesn&#39;t it? Hard work, determination, it&#39;s what we do. Now, also, we&#39;ve got here a
team meeting agenda template. So, you can just fill this
out and send it out to people. It&#39;s already done. There it is. It&#39;s a sample for you to use,
because then we have a template also for the team
meeting minutes. In your team meetings,
have you assigned roles? Have you ever had a team where
you were assigned roles, that you&#39;re the cheerleader? You&#39;re the devil&#39;s advocate? You&#39;re the task master? You&#39;re the time master? Keep us on time. Keep us on task. Look for the good points. Look for the bad points. It&#39;s very easy to have those
role models when you&#39;re starting on a team that you are just
starting to create, because you go through that
storming, norming phase. Right? Because people don&#39;t want to say
anything bad, because, &quot;That&#39;s not my nature. No. That&#39;s my role.&quot; Let&#39;s look for the obvious,
what are the downsides of this? Get them out there. Get them vocal. There&#39;s things to do for that. Now, this template was brought
to you by the Washington State Tool Kit, and
this is a resource. It&#39;s 300 pages. That&#39;s why you&#39;re not getting
it as a handout paper, but I do have the link for you. Data literacy teams, here it is. It&#39;s a one-day session, could
be two-day session, on data literacy for professionals
for education. It has workbooks. It has modules. It has templates. I was really wanting to think
about like taking Washington State off of it and put
Pennsylvania on there, but I&#39;m not doing that. All right? But it&#39;s a great tool kit. Here it is. Get your team leader. Get your team together. Go through this, so you&#39;re all
on the same page, and you all use the same vocabulary, so that
everybody knows, when we speak about this, this is what
we mean in this district. And you use that
through tool kit. The other one that works is
Using Data to Improve Schools. Okay? And, this
is a great source. And, again, it is from the
Department of Ed, I believe. No, the American Association
of School Administrators. But, again, it&#39;s in chapters. Why data matters. And it gives you handouts
and work and schedules, and everything you need to
put together professional development for
using data in schools. Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Here it is. Okay? We also have Data Team Meetings,
Steps and Structures, from the Center for Performance
Assessment for data teams, and it gives you everything that
you need to help your data team organize here. This is what the Washington
State Tool Kit used. You&#39;re also going to see
repeatedly this cycle. Now, going through your course
of study to get where you are, you&#39;ve seen this before. You know this. Other people in your teams may
not see this and don&#39;t work this way. Do not assume that just because
they have a Master&#39;s degree that they have gone through
this course of study. Help them articulate
questions, identify the data. Are you going to give them the
data you&#39;re going to look at? Are we going to look at the
issue, and then decide what data to look at? Choices for your data team. Okay? Understand the issues. If you are looking at
alternative ed programs, then you want to have a team that&#39;s
going to understand the issues of community, and challenges for
students who are not engaged. Because if you treat those
kids like they&#39;re typical learners...Have you ever
worked with those kids that are disengaged? They&#39;re not your
typical learners. If they were, they
would be successful. So, when you&#39;re looking at
students who are disengaged and not successful, you have
to treat them as they are. They&#39;re different, because
otherwise, it&#39;s a whole lot like waving to Stevie Wonder. You feel good about it,
but he doesn&#39;t care. Okay? So, think about that. Thanks for getting that. Victoria Bernhardt is another
area of research that shows you the different layers
to disaggregate data. Now, I know you know this,
because that&#39;s why you are where you are, but, again, other
people don&#39;t know how to peel the layers, how to get through
the parfait to get to the gooey good stuff at the bottom. Right? So, Victoria Bernhardt is there
to provide those questions. Now, we also have root cause
analysis, and this comes out of the Washington State
Tool Kit, that gives you how to do the analysis. How do you look at root cause? How do you get to
the bottom of it? We had a girl one time, I heard
about a girl that was late every day for school. She came to school every day,
secondary, at 9:30 in the morning, every day, 9:30. She had in-school suspension. She still came to school at
9:30 in the morning, every day. They gave her
out-of-school suspension. She still came to
school every day at 9:30. They fined, every
day at 9:30. Nothing. None of the consequences
deterred the tardiness, until finally, in the exhaustive
approach that they did that was on record and policy, she
was sent to AEDY, costing the district money. Until, finally, somebody asked
her why she was late every day at 9:30. She said, &quot;My mom
works night work. She doesn&#39;t get home until
8:00 in the morning, and she&#39;s exhausted. I get my younger brother and
sister up, and take them to elementary school, so I know
they&#39;re safe, and then I come to school.&quot; Now, how did it get to that
point, before you started looking at the
questions for the data? Start looking for the
gooey center at the bottom of the parfait. Sometimes you don&#39;t have to go
that far, but it&#39;s so worth it when you get there. All right? It&#39;s not necessarily the
answers that are important. It&#39;s the discussion. When do you have an opportunity
to sit with your peers and talk in a professional format, with a
professional discussion, to look at issues? When was the last
time you did that? Oh, yes. I came to the conference. And, the conference is two days,
and now you&#39;re going to go back. And, are you going to
debrief with somebody? Is it going to be official? Are you just going to...
like, over lunch, we talked about this? The discussion is
what&#39;s important. It&#39;s always
beginning the discussion. Once you know,
what do you do? Okay? Plan and take action. There is no sense in knowing
something, if you&#39;re not going to do anything about it. Okay? Do you know the phrase
&quot;ignorance is bliss?&quot; Yes? Where did that phrase come from? Back when I was dating James
Garfield, in 1881, he was shot in the train station. He was shot in the back. Okay? But he did not die right away. And, in fact, today, he would
not have died at all, as we saw with Ronald Reagan. No, I didn&#39;t date him,
because I didn&#39;t like Nancy. So, James Garfield was shot in
the back, and it was just at that time in life when they
started looking at germs, these microscopic things
that could kill you. But, yet, the Victorian medical
people thought that, &quot;It doesn&#39;t exist if I can&#39;t see it.&quot; James Lister, from England, was
in the United States, and had talked at a conference about
a simple thing you could do is wash your hands
before examining a patient. Doctor Bliss, was his name,
was the lead doctor for James Garfield&#39;s medical team, and he
said that was bunk, and he came right in off the street and
probed the wound with his bare hand. Of course, after he had petted
the horse and tied up the horse and the carriage. Right? James Garfield did
not die from his wounds. He died from the medical
practice that tried to save him. Ignorance is bliss. Plan and take action. Do what needs to be done to
have a healthy and vital student engaged in education. Evaluate your results. Is it working? Take notes. If it&#39;s not working,
guess who has to change? The adults. If you&#39;re changing a culture,
you have to be the one that takes the actions. Talk about the expectations. When do you think teachers are
going to start looking at data? When is the team
going to get together? How often do
they have to do this? Has anybody ever sent a
teenager out to clean the car? Do they clean it to
your specifications? Why? I sent my son
out to clean the car. I said, &quot;Clean the car out. It&#39;s a mess.&quot; My tires were so shiny. The inside still
had French fries. All right? What&#39;s the expectation? Communicate it so that everybody
meets the expectations. Now, we&#39;re going to
look at the interventions. We have an intervention catalog
in our Early Warning System, and in our Early Warning
System...I don&#39;t have it. I gave it away...we have a REL
document called the Toolkit for Dropout Prevention, and
it&#39;s up in their booth. It&#39;s spiral bound. It&#39;s green, and it is so cool. It has a checklist. It has recommendations, and it
has a checklist for each one of the recommendations, and how you
implement that in your school. Now, if it&#39;s good for dropout,
it&#39;s good for every student, every student, because we
want every student engaged. All right? And, sometimes, when we look for
interventions, we have to look at these five areas. You have to look at an
intervention that is systemic. Is it something we can change,
because our policies may be wrong? Is it social? Kids have graffiti
because it&#39;s a social issue. They don&#39;t have social skills. It&#39;s academic, it&#39;s
community, or it&#39;s personal. Those are the areas to look
at when you&#39;re looking at interventions
based from the data. Everybody has an intervention
catalog in their heads. Your school has resources
they go to regularly to help students, but it&#39;s kept in
your head, and it&#39;s kept in your head. And, collectively,
we have a catalog. What we are advocating for
you to do is write it down. We have a template and a
spreadsheet that you just fill out, and that is a composite
then of everybody&#39;s knowledge. It can&#39;t replace a person,
but it helps support it. So, look for
your resources. Okay? Make your data driven decisions,
and you are going to be looking for continuous improvement. I like looking at scoring
guides, because they are a self assessment. Okay? And this is from the Education
for the Future&#39;s initiative. Look where you are, and it gives
you the roadmap of where you want to be, and
what it looks like. So that when I say, &quot;Clean the
car,&quot; it means get the French fries out of the back seat. Access to all training
materials, okay, are on the SAS [Standards Aligned
System] website. Are you familiar with SAS? Okay. They&#39;re on the SAS website. I have put them into the
professional learning community for the Early
Warning System, the EWS. So, you&#39;re going to
also look...you&#39;re going to look there. You are also going to look
up here at the REL for Using Student Achievement
Data to Support Instructional Decision Making. Again, REL has
given us what we need. They&#39;ve given us a
common vocabulary. They give us recommendations,
and they help a district implement it. It&#39;s all right here. So, your professional
development now, once you get them to read the data,
what do we do with the data? It&#39;s here. Okay? So, check out REL. Check out all of these. All of these documents
are in the SAS site. There we are. Just click them. Download them. Or you can just go to the
REL site and look at their resources. Okay? So, I&#39;ve given you a basic of
everything you need to do to start, reinforcing what you do,
and we are here to assist you in any way we can. Invite us to come in,
and we will help you. We are there to
make you look good. PDE is not going to come in and
do the professional development for you. We&#39;re going to be there to help
you provide the professional development. So, this comes from within. Culture and using
data comes from within. We are here to help you be the
leader, and be and do and change the world like
you want to. Okay? So, anything I can do to
help you, please let us know. Please check out the REL...
the REL booth, and thank you very much.
