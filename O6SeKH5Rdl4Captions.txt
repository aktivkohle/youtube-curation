(upbeat techo music) - I&#39;m never interested 
in bullshitting. We are going to, 
not a mobile first world, we&#39;re going to 
a mobile-only world. AI and automation 
will never stop. We&#39;re gonna become robots. And nostalgia is the most under-priced 
asset in our society. I can buy a business
for $80 million, and sell it for $4.6 billion. Can we win? Like can we fuckin&#39; sell shit? Losing is comfortable. Losing is delicious. There&#39;s just no other gear. Your destiny is your destiny. It&#39;s on you. I just don&#39;t even 
know how not to be me. - I know we said we weren&#39;t
gonna have any speakers at this event, but I didn&#39;t say Q and A&#39;s. So, we&#39;re very, super grateful that Gary
was able to join us. Most of you, anybody
not familiar with Gary? It&#39;s a pretty tuned in audience! - [Gary] It motivates me! - Well yeah, there&#39;s a
lot of people, obviously, there was a little 
bit of a procession when he was coming in, almost like a wedding
or something like that. Super excited, Gary&#39;s here
for just a little bit. I know he has a conference
call right around the corner, so we&#39;re just gonna go
right into a Q and A. Gary&#39;s amazing 
when it comes to rants, it&#39;s funny how I actually
decided on Gary. We did a comedian in year
two of Mastermind Talks, during a dinner. And it was so well received, and I was like, man it&#39;s be
great to have like a comedian who actually could deliver
great business stuff, and I was like fuck, 
Gary&#39;s hilarious! So, that&#39;s why 
we have Gary here. So, ladies and gentlemen,
no introduction needed, Gary Vaynerchuk! (applause) - Thank you. Thank you. Super pumped to be here. Obviously a lot of friends
that I know intimately, so that makes it a lot of fun. Yeah, you know, 
obviously a lot of what I&#39;ve been focused on
for the last couple years has been to 
actually push my brand into a place where 
I could go to an event and just do Q and A. Which I think 
at the end of the day, knowing so many of you, I&#39;m and will always be concerned about can I bore people? Can it become boring? And there&#39;s a lot of
you that really know me, the truth is there&#39;s so
few things I believe in. There&#39;s really only three
or four true kind of like principles that I believe in. Luckily for me, and
luckily for so many of us, we got to live during this
era where everything changes so much. I&#39;m baffled by people not
understanding what happens when we move 
to a Snapchat universe, all the same shit that happened
on every other platform that had people&#39;s attention, whether it&#39;s print or radio,
television, or Facebook, so for me, thank God that
the markets gonna move on an everyday basis and
thank God people get old. And what I mean 
by people getting old is at South by Southwest 
it was funny. Chris Sacca exposed this thing
in his big Vanity Fair piece, which we make fun of, but for years we had 
this very small group that at South-by would get
together at like midnight and go in literally
just a small hotel room, just sit there 
and we would basically, we called it the jam session, 
all it was was literally &quot;Is Pinterest
worth a billion dollars?&quot; &quot;What do you think is
gonna happen with Uber?&quot; and we did that for 
seven or eight years, it was really interesting
to see where people were right and wrong, and it was just amazing
debates and I learned so much. But to me the 
Q and A and the banter and the content 
is so imperative. It was two years ago at the
jam session where literally the founders, 
the founders of Twitter and Instagram and these
tools poo-poohed Snapchat. And like just really, 
it was crazy. I was literally emphatically
yelling at them, like you guys changed
the world, and everybody said the same shit about
your product five years ago, how did you get so old so fast? (audience laughs) And so you know, obviously
whether it&#39;s entrepreneurship or investing or 
running a company, I think for the people here
that have had the time, &#39;cause I know some 
of you are so busy, in the last six months to a
year I&#39;ve been spending a lot more time on what really
has allowed me the privilege of standing in 
front of you which is, I&#39;m not really IQ strong,
I&#39;m really probably, I would actually argue 
that I&#39;m probably below-average to average on IQ, but I do think my parents
blessed me with over-the-top EQ, and my emotional intelligence
and self-awareness and empathy and the way 
I built my, you know, the reason VaynerMedia has
gone from 30 to 650 people and hasn&#39;t broke is
predicated so much on EQ. And then consumer behavior, like projecting what 
I think you guys are gonna do before you realize 
you&#39;re gonna do it, has a little bit to do
with that stuff as well. So, thrilled to go anywhere, I&#39;m real excited to do Q and
A and thanks for having me. Are you guys gonna mic it? You gonna run it? Great. Let&#39;s just get into it. Just name and question. - [Cameron] Cameron Herold, 
I&#39;ve got a question regarding second in command. I ran a session today about
your Chief Operating Officer. I wanna know who is
running VaynerMedia for you and what makes the relationship between you and 
that person so strong. - So that&#39;s an 
interesting question, and an interesting time
to ask that question. This Friday, my brother
A.J. who&#39;s been the C.O.O. of VaynerMedia 
from the beginning is leaving the company. I think some of you might
have read a month ago AJ finally announced, cause he&#39;s been 
very private about it, my brother has Crohn&#39;s Disease. And truth is, and I know
some of you know AJ, AJ and I are really different, just like I&#39;m much more, I mean AJ is thrilled
to have his seven friends and I&#39;m desperate 
to be deep friends with every fucking 
person in here. (laughter) And so AJ was no question the C.O.O. of the company, for the first five or six years. Over the last year and a
half we knew this was coming so we commoditized him out. There&#39;s a guy by the 
name of James Orsini, who ran for 25 years ran big
agencies, Satchi and Satchi and things of that nature. You know the truth is and something I&#39;ve been 
talking a lot about with my own friends,
not as much publicly, maybe John knows, very few
people know this in this room, maybe one or two, I really run VaynerMedia. Like I think because I play
GaryVee as my side hustle, and because I&#39;m good at it, and because I work 
18 hours a day, a far majority in this room,
including people like Dale, like people at Yanek, like people I really know, 
I don&#39;t think really understand how much I actually 
operate the business. And so, for me, every operational decision runs through me, I&#39;ve got a lot of
context on it, I&#39;m there. And I think the key, and I&#39;d be curious and we
can maybe talk afterwards, I think the key for me
in having a number two, or number three, is less
about them running it in the way that you framed it, it&#39;s more about them complimenting the things
that you&#39;re not good at. Like, I&#39;m very self-aware.
Right? For example, knowing that
20% of you, a lot of you don&#39;t know me, but knowing
the ones that know me knowing that 20% of
you didn&#39;t even like me on first impression 
at a conference or things of that nature, like self-awareness 
is imperative. And as an operator, 
I&#39;m very self-aware and I know where my
short-comings are. And so I think for anybody
here that&#39;s looking to scale, I think there&#39;s way too much
pride in this collective room, like nobody here is 
good at everything. And that&#39;s super real. And I think we all know that. And we have strengths and
weaknesses and I think, I&#39;ve been a guy, and I&#39;ve watched a lot of
companies do this at scale, I really believe on tripling
down in your strengths. I do not, I&#39;m not a big fan
on working on your weaknesses. I think you have to be
dangerous in your weaknesses, like I&#39;m not a dope when
it comes to the finances or the other things 
that I don&#39;t wanna do, but I&#39;m far from 
being interested in being world-class in it, It just doesn&#39;t leave 
enough room for you to be world-class at
what comes natural to you, which is always 
gonna have more upside. So, it&#39;s been AJ, 
it&#39;s gonna be James, I&#39;m building something else, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure
a lot of you that have bigger organizations if you&#39;re
not in a solo entrepreneur land and if you&#39;ve 
run companies, one of the things that 
I realize and I realize I did at Wine Library and I&#39;m gonna make
it official at VaynerMedia, is I&#39;m gonna create something
called Office of the CEO. So there&#39;s gonna be these six
people and they&#39;re my family, they&#39;re the inner circle,
they&#39;re the people that nobody else in the
company tells anything to because they know that
the second they tell them they&#39;re gonna tell me, right? Everybody&#39;s got 
that inner circle, and by the way, some of them are ranked
number five in the company, and another person might
be number 174 salary level, so now I&#39;m gonna 
make it official because they just help me scale. When there&#39;s 
that level of trust, I think sometimes people
silo a level of trust just to your right-hand
woman, right-hand man, like one or two people, I actually am looking for scale, and so I&#39;m gonna build
a five, six person team that basically is just
gonna take care of the thing that&#39;s the most important 
to me right now. Like we just landed one of the
biggest banks in the country. I can&#39;t even announce it yet. One of the biggest 
banks in the country, it&#39;s gonna be 30% 
of our revenue, it&#39;s an enormously big client, I really need to make 
sure it goes well. I need to put everything on it besides the great 
team I put on it. So they&#39;ll keep an eye on that. And they&#39;ll keep an eye
on this one employee that I think is a superstar
and they&#39;re gonna vet it, so the other thing I would
give a recommendation to that has I think thematics
into were you&#39;re going, is building an inner circle
that everybody in the company knows is you. Just even the five people within an organization 
in that group won&#39;t even have 
a title within it. It&#39;s just gonna be, 
that&#39;s what they are. Office of the CEO. Something to consider that
I see a lot of value in. Thanks for your question, man. - [David] Dude, David Osborne
I was born in Austin-- - Are you literally that lazy? You just... You couldn&#39;t go there?
(laughing audience) - [David] Gotta 
sit up front. - Just gonna stay up here. - [David] So...
(laughing audience) Dude, I was born 
in Austin, Texas. Two questions: One, what the fuck is Snapchat? Man, I got on it because
you told me to get on it, and I still don&#39;t know 
what the fuck it is or why I&#39;m on it!
(laughing audience) I know a lot of young 
people follow me, and I got no idea why-- - [Gary] That&#39;s a very common
marketers&#39; question right now. - The second one 
is what you invest in outside of VaynerMedia. Do you put money in
anything that cash flows or anything like that? - [Gary] Got it, so... I&#39;ll answer second one,
because it&#39;s very detailed. I had a $25 million venture fund called Vayner/RSE. I&#39;m closing one 
called Vayner Capital, that I&#39;ll be announcing
in the next month or so. It&#39;s gonna be a $55 to 
70 million fund, very different. Vayner/RSE was 25 million,
when I made 100 investments. So a lot of different things, more angel investing 
like I used to do. This new one I&#39;m gonna
raise 50 to probably end up being 60, 
70 million dollars. I&#39;m probably only gonna
invest in 10 companies. So it&#39;s going to be 
much later stage, and I&#39;m use VaynerMedia
and its capabilities to help the outcome of companies
that are further along. So I&#39;ve always Angel-- I&#39;ve made up net net 
between Wine Library, which has been a very 
successful business for a very long time,
that I get income from &#39;cause I ran it and 
it&#39;s family business, Vayner, I get seven 
figure book advances, and I get paid 
six figures to speak. Like with all that
lucrativeness, the investment in Uber and Twitter and Facebook
and Tumblr and Buddy Media those are gonna end up
making me the most money. So that&#39;s what I do. And then, but... I really truly see 
myself as an operator. You know, I will never 
not run a business. At scale, by the way. I&#39;ll never-- And this is a fun thing
to say in this room, I will never be 
GaryVee full-time. Like, even though
it&#39;s gotten to a place, and it&#39;s starting 
to get to a place where I think I can make a
lotta lotta money doing it, I just really enjoy 
running businesses. Snapchat is very simple. I mean, it&#39;s just
attention arbitrage, right? It&#39;s... It&#39;s a platform that people are consuming their content from. There&#39;s nothing else to say. The stories, have you gotten to a point
where you understand-- That&#39;s the newsfeed. It just looks a 
little bit different. You know, it&#39;s interesting. If you take your phone right now and look at 
every social network: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn--
if you consider it that, Pinterest... Like if you literally put all seven of the things 
we group up with: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Pinterest, Instagram They all, functionally, 
are the same. It&#39;s basically one
hardcore piece of content, and then social commentary
in one shape or form, and then you just go this way. Snapchat has been 
the most confusing, &#39;cause it had totally
different UI/UX experience left and right, up and
down, very confusing. What&#39;s interesting
though, on the flip side, is if we were to go and I&#39;m actually thinking
about making this video, because I&#39;ve just realized
this through friends and family that are what I call
normals, not in our world. Just like kids I went to
high school with, right? If you go to 
Times Square right now, and you give 20 people Snapchat, that have never used it, within an hour, 
if you help them, within an hour, 
they really understand it. And just to give you context, that never happened 
with Twitter. As somebody whose grown
up in the last 10 years, normals never fully
fully understood Twitter, and they really 
understand Snapchat, and they&#39;re addicted to it. And so... Just another place for
people to create content. You know. I think the bigger thing-- The reason I&#39;m so bullish on it and the reason in 
December and January I got very loud about it, even though I&#39;ve been talking
about it for two years, is DJ Khaled was the cherry
on top of understanding, and we kinda started talking
about a Vayner in September, &quot;shit.&quot; 30, 40 year olds are starting
to use this and for real, and this is how they all go, either they start in a
tech-nerd environment or a kid environment, right? Then they bubble up, and then the first thing you&#39;ll
notice is 30 to 40-year-olds in New York, San Francisco,
and L.A using it, and then that will happen in
the middle of the country. And then it&#39;ll 
go 40, 50, 60, 70. Snapchat&#39;s already bigger than
every other social network that&#39;s come before it,
except for Facebook. Already, right now. Instagram, yes, but Instagram&#39;s such a weird
one cause it got bought 500 days into its lifecycle. And so it got vigged 
so much by Facebook. And so... It&#39;s just an important 
place man. I, for this room, there&#39;s no
more important place right now to figure out how to story
tell and do what you do. How you communicate, what you
sell, except contextually, you have to figure out how that works in a 
Snapchat environment. Because the biggest fear
I have for people that are entrepreneurs, growth hackers,
smart, doing their thing, is we&#39;re going to not
a mobile first world. We&#39;re going to a 
mobile only world. Right, like, I&#39;m on a three-day
business trip right now. No laptop, this is it. That blows my mind. Like, that&#39;s just crazy to me, that I don&#39;t have my laptop. I&#39;m running business-- 
like I do stuff! This is not like, you know, and so there&#39;s a lot of 
people here that rely on their tactics
in a digital environment based on 
landing page optimization and all the things 
they think about in a desktop universe. And so A, what you&#39;re 
doing on your website and how you&#39;re 
storytelling to the world, you have to figure 
out mobile only and B, and probably 
more importantly, as you guys know, it&#39;s being
contextual and relevant in all these other channels, as well as being relevant
in your home base. And so, that&#39;s that... (microphone) - [Zach] Hey Gary, 
my name is Zach Obront. Question is, I&#39;ve heard you
mention before that you think of VaynerMedia
as 650 people to leverage you. - Yes, the scalable version 
of my marketing talent, yes. - [Zach] What&#39;s the 
thinking both from a why perspective and a how
perspective of doing that versus the most 
typical agency model of trying to remove yourself or make it more
self-sufficient without you? - Well it is self-sufficient
without me. And why don&#39;t you hold
don&#39;t you hold the mic because there might 
be a detail here. - [Zach] Yeah. - It&#39;s fully self-sufficient
without me. I think, again in the same
way as your first question, I always think the
paradox of how I run shit and what I&#39;m excited 
about to keep you interested for 10, 20, 30 years Most of what it looks
like is going on isn&#39;t. I think you&#39;d be very
fascinated by the fact that, I don&#39;t know, of the 100 million dollars in revenue from 
VaynerMedia will do this year, 60 or 70 of it has 
almost has nothing, like I don&#39;t even 
know the client. Nothing. They&#39;re not buying 
Gary Vaynerchuk, of course once in a while
they may think that, but we&#39;re very clear
that this is an agency. So it&#39;s very 
self-sufficient without me. But why it&#39;s the scalable
version of me is the craft that 
the agency is doing. Meaning we&#39;re leaving a ton
of fucking money on the table, by not doing banner ads,
by not doing search, by not doing a ton of shit. We probably left $25 million straight up on the table, by not wanting 
to build websites. When I say it&#39;s a 
scalable version of me, my main plan seven years
ago was, how am I gonna buy- As I started meeting 
Zucks and Travis and stuff, I was like, 
&quot;Fuck I&#39;m not these guys. &quot;This is not who I am.&quot; And back to 
self-awareness, I&#39;m like, so I&#39;m not gonna make my money the way they&#39;re 
gonna make their money. Seven years ago, I&#39;m like,
&quot;How am I gonna buy the Jets?&quot; Right, and so...
(laughing) I decided that what I was
better at than all of them was I could sell shit
better than them and stuff. And then I kinda gave it a
lot of thought for a year, and I said, &quot;Huh.&quot; There&#39;s this guy by the
name of Dean Metropoulos, he&#39;s just a private equity guy, but he did something 
that I believe in. I&#39;m a very big believer 
that nostalgia is the most under-priced
asset in our society. For example, 
had I been further along, and I wouldn&#39;t have seen it, but had I been further along, it would&#39;ve made sense for me
to buy Marvel in bankruptcy and then make it into movies and make a trillion dollars. That makes sense to me, because the Hulk has
been around for a while. Like, Spiderman matters. Dean Metropoulos bought 
Tuna Under The Sea tuna fish, he bought 
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, he bought Bazooka Joe Gum, and then he just runs them better and flips them. For me, I wanna buy brands like Snickers or PUMA or
Lacoste or I don&#39;t know, Timex or 
Peter Pan Peanut Butter. I wanna buy brands that have been neglected 
that are under-priced. Run them through 
the VaynerMedia machine, and then flips them, because 
those are the kinda things you-- I can buy a business
for $80 million and sell it for $4.6 billion, if I can do what I&#39;ve done in two businesses that 
I&#39;ve ever run, which is growth revenue,
extraordinarily quick. That&#39;s what I set out to do, which meant that was gonna
have to eat shit for 10 years, at the height-- and again, Dan
a couple people here, you guys knew me, like 
I had a lot of leverage in 2007 &#39;8, &#39;9, &#39;10, I was in it. I was in it. When I announced
VaynerMedia Zucks texted me and said, 
&quot;The fuck are you doing? &quot;Building an agency, 
client services?&quot; I was a disappointment to all
my tech-titan friends. I mean it! Like, straight up
disappointment. But, I was like, 
&quot;Cool, you go do you &quot;and make trillions 
and change the world.&quot; (audience laughter) I just need to make 
$4 billion to buy the Jets. And so this is the only
way I know how to do it. And so it look a lot of
humility and patience to get here seven years
later and have what I have. It also took the fact
that I had to know that my people skills were much
better than everybody else&#39;s. So that I&#39;d be able to keep. Because my vulnerability is
they could leave tomorrow. Not building a product,
I&#39;m not in SaaS business. But I also had 
enormous confidence in my ability on a people level. And so that&#39;s where we&#39;re at. And so that&#39;s what 
I mean by that. - [Zach] Awesome, thank you. - Yeah. - [Ben] Hey, I&#39;m Ben Greenfield,
fitness.com/snapchat. (laughter) On page seven of your book, which I&#39;ve owned for about
10 minutes now, it rocks. You talk about how one
of the biggest lessons that you learned in 2015 was
that you had to start taking better care of yourself. - Yes, health-wise. - [Ben] And I&#39;m curious to get a little bit more of
the nitty-gritty details about that, like what&#39;d you
do as a busy family man, entrepreneur to start
taking care of yourself? - Well John why don&#39;t
you come up here, and why don&#39;t we tell 
this story together? (laughter) - [John] I was hoping 
you&#39;d say that. - You got it. - Is there a mic up here? - Yeah, let&#39;s get a 
mic for this man, this man has a 
lot to do with it. Let&#39;s clap it up for this guy. (audience applauds) - Hey, guys. This is very exciting. - I&#39;ll let him take over
at some point, &#39;cause he&#39;ll know where to take over,
I&#39;ll give you the context. Basically, 
super-fuckin&#39; random, like just random fuckin&#39; flight from 
San Francisco to New York. I&#39;m just sitting there
and I&#39;m like you know, when am I gonna take care
of this health thing? I know that it&#39;s not right,
I know I&#39;m not winning, I got into a good place in
my head around my health where I looked at it like
a business, and I said I&#39;m not doing the behavior
that&#39;s gonna make me successful and eventually this 
is gonna catch up, and the weird thing is,
it got to a place where I was like, wow, 
I don&#39;t do anything right. I eat like shit, I&#39;ve never
worked out once in my life, and somehow I can literally
work 18 hours a day and not be tired, and my
fat is equally proportioned through my entire 
body so it&#39;s hiding (audience laughs) how fat I am and like inside
I must be fuckin&#39; Yokozuna from WWF but it&#39;s 
not like, you know. And so, I just started 
talking to myself, I talk to myself a lot, and I was like, 
I need to address this. So that&#39;s what I said, and
then the flight&#39;s delayed. Super funny, it happens, 
no big deal. And I&#39;m just talking and
talking, and I was like you know what, when 
I turned 30, I freaked my shit with Wine Library and 
I started Wine Library TV and got into tech and I
completely changed my behavior. On my 30th birthday. Driving to Wine Library,
looking in my rear view mirror, I&#39;m like, literally this is
what happened, my birthday, my 30th birthday, 
I looked at myself dead in the mirror, in my rear
view mirror, and I said &quot;You&#39;re fuckin&#39; full of shit.&quot; and what I would say to myself, talking to myself I was like, you say that you&#39;re gonna
buy the New York Jets, none of your behavior
maps you pulling that off. And so if you&#39;re gonna do
it, you better lay down some serious foundation
from 30 to 40 because family&#39;s coming and all this,
right, so I said to myself, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic
if on my 40th birthday, &quot;because I don&#39;t think 
I need another, &quot;what am I gonna work,
from 19 hours a day to 24?&quot; I was like, that&#39;s not
gonna be it, I was like, you know what, health. That&#39;d be a really 
good one to address, let me get my 
shit together there and literally before 
the flight took over, I said, &#39;cause I was
38 and four months old, I was like, fuck it, 
why wait &#39;till 40? I&#39;ll do it at 39. And then, literally, 
I was like you know what, fuck it, I&#39;ll do it 
as soon as possible. And so that happened 
about a year and a half after we met where I tried my first version
of what I just told you, which was I decided to go
the peer pressure route, and I publicly Tweeted and
Facebooked that I wanted to get a trainer that&#39;s
when you took over. - Yeah, so this is 2011, 
I think? - Mhmmm. Maybe &#39;12. - It was right when 
Thank You Economy came out. - Okay &#39;11. - 2011-ish and Gary and I met. he was giving a talk at
the Apple Store in SoHo, I went down in my Jets gear which is not like me blowing
Gary, I&#39;m just a big fuckin&#39; Jets fan to my ever-lasting
dismay and so we met, we chat a little bit, just
rapport building relationships and as most people do
inappropriately, he commented on my physique,
turned out I was trainer, give him my card, 
which he then lost. Couple week later-- - I threw it out. - Yeah, fuck this. (audience laughs) &#39;Cause at that point I was
like, 2011 John was like I&#39;m super professional, 
business cards. I should have just 
fuckin&#39; Tweeted at him. And then, he put up on Facebook that he needed a trainer 
and so people did what is inexplicable to me, people who follow Gary, instead of leveraging 
what they do, they all just jumped on
that Facebook thread, pick me, pick me, pick me and the shit that Gary
talks about not doing. And so I was like fuck that and I just posted on my Facebook and sent everyone 
on my page over to blow up his 
thread and so then, I got an email 
maybe 20 minutes later from Phil Torano who was
then Gary&#39;s assistant and that Monday, I was
in the gym with Gary. So the plan, initially, 
was to train four to five days a week, 
for an hour and then Gary made it a
habit of cancelling on me at least three times a week. And I let him off the hook. It was really cool to
be working with Gary. But we do a lot 
of work together. And then-- - That story, I&#39;ll jump
in, so that&#39;s right. Because, by the way, 
and I talk a lot about it in business, 
for some of you that are following along. I talk about 
religion over tactics. I just wasn&#39;t in 
the religious place to take care of my health. I was half pregnant,
that&#39;s why I cancelled. I&#39;m publicly saying 
I never get sick. He&#39;s supposed to work 
out with me at 6:30, at 6:22 I&#39;m like, dude, 
I&#39;m so sick. (audience laughs) - Yeah, mother fucker. I was in West Village 
at the time going to the Upper East Side like a $40 cab ride. And it&#39;s like, 
this mother fucker. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s cool bro. - We built a really 
nice relationship and when I made that decision, the first thing 
I did was call him and I said, &quot;I need your help.&quot; And what my plan was, 
was what I realized, by the way, in that moment, was I was not held 
accountable to myself. - Right, and so he
called me and he&#39;s like, &quot;I have this crazy idea.&quot; &quot;Tell me if it&#39;s retarded.&quot; &quot;What I would like to 
do is hire someone &quot;to be completely 
in charge of my body.&quot; &quot;I want to bring 
them on full time &quot;as staff and 
they&#39;re going to be &quot;in charge of my food, &quot;they&#39;re going to 
travel with me, &quot;take care of my 
workouts and everything.&quot; And I said, &quot;I think 
it&#39;s a great idea &quot;if you don&#39;t fuckin&#39;
cancel on them all the time. &quot;But you also have to
find somebody who&#39;s good.&quot; You got to, someone who
sits in the venn diagram of being good enough for me to feel comfortable 
recommending them. I had moved to L.A. 
at this point, I was no longer 
eligible for this job. And they have to 
be good enough, they have to be at a
point in their business where it makes sense to
only have one client. It needs to make sense in
all these different facets. And so, the only guy 
I could think of was a kid who had started
as an intern for me, he became my 
prodigy and then started his own business, Mike Vacanti. And so Gary had 
trained with him briefly. - That was the worse four months like two sessions.
- Yeah like in four months he had like three sessions. And so, I was like, 
&quot;Mike will kill it for you.&quot; He really is, 
he&#39;s a great trainer and a phenomenal dude and I knew that he had the 
right metal to be able to work with Gary 
and travel with him 300 days out of year at points. And so that&#39;s how it started. And so Mike became 
the CEO of Gary&#39;s body and since then, 
Gary has made tremendous physical changes and it&#39;s also given him a lot more energy and that&#39;s more or 
less the gist of that. - Has not given me more energy. I&#39;m just fully, fully, has not. (audience laughs) - He&#39;s less broken than he was. - No, no, I mean look, look. I mean, do I expect a
57 like I&#39;m not naive that there&#39;s so much good that&#39;s supposed to 
happen but like, I never want to say things
that haven&#39;t happened. I don&#39;t have more energy. What I do have, is at least my left 
glute is now active. (audience laughs) That is something I have now. Who knew that a glute
could go so inactive? Go sit down, I got more to do. - Here you go man. - Thanks, good to see you, 
love you bro. (audience claps) So, the answer is and this is how I believe 
about every business. I talk a lot about 
fitness entrepreneurs who are so good 
about their physique and their regime and all that, but then, in their business, their looking for the secret or the 12 courses that
don&#39;t let them do the work. Once I made the 
religious decision to do the work and I had
one interesting unlock that maybe can
help you in some way. I figured out, 
in that really zen place. I was like, fuck, 
it&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m not competitive with myself. I don&#39;t give a shit 
if I run four minutes and nine seconds and
yesterday I did 4:11. I&#39;m competitive with everything
in the world but myself. And so I realized 
I needed to be held accountable to another human. I work out every single
day and don&#39;t cheat. I&#39;ve been unbelievable 
&#39;cause I don&#39;t want to let Mike down. And because, 
I know every morning I&#39;m going to go on the scale and Mike&#39;s going to know. I&#39;ve suffocated 
myself and by the way, Mike&#39;s tenure of 
two years all-in, is done July seventh. I have a new guy 
starting for three years. And I&#39;m very comfortable 
in saying this, if I was ever to stop doing it, I would revert back. So many people after 
six months or a year, they&#39;re like, &quot;All right Gary, &quot;you don&#39;t need Mike anymore.&quot; &quot;You got it now.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; It&#39;s the accountability 
to another person is what was the 
break through for me. - Cool. Yeah, you 
got it brother. - [Man] Hi, Gary.
- Hey, man. - [Man] I&#39;d like to
ask ask about chatbots, do you think that&#39;s gonna
be the next big thing? Should we be 
investing in chatbots? - Like bots in general? - [Man] Or, 
messenger as a platform? - Yeah, I mean, look. 
It&#39;s huge in Asia, there&#39;s enormous 
opportunities for bots to make life more scalable, things of that nature. So yeah, do I think bots in
messaging apps are a pillar? Yeah, I do. And I think it&#39;s
gonna take 3, 4, 5, years, for it to be a real scale,
but it&#39;s talking about search in &#39;01 or email
in &#39;96 or social in &#39;07, I think it&#39;s a real genre. And here&#39;s what&#39;s 
more important: it&#39;s kinda like Google
Glass or other things that have not worked out, whether it works or not AI and automation 
will never stop. We&#39;re gonna become robots. So, whether bots on messenger
become the way you win is far more irrelevant 
than the fact that you get the taste
of what the concept is, so that if in
two to four, seven, nine, 14 years from now it&#39;s VR augmented execution
that breaks through for you. The thing that pisses me
off is how many of you have not used Snapchat &#39;cause you &quot;think it&#39;s a waste of time &quot;in case it&#39;s a fad&quot; and you don&#39;t realize the
tasting the execution sets you up for the next thing. I wasted, I wasted a
fuckload of time on Socialcam because it was a fad
except it taught me 90% of what made me successful
on Vine and Instagram video and Snapchat, and so please, enough of &quot;well what if
this is here tomorrow?&quot; Who gives a fuck? 
It&#39;s here right now, milk it for what it is,
learn what it means, and it&#39;s gonna 
iterate on top of that and that&#39;s why I think bots
are massively important for this group, not because
you figured out what bot to make on Slack 
or on Facebook Messenger to build your business,
but because you&#39;ll learn what bot thinking is, how
humans interact with augmented, and then learn 
from that and ideate. You got it. - [Dave] Hey, I&#39;m Dave Asprey, The &quot;Bulletproof&quot; coffee guy. - Hey man.
- [Dave] Hey. You mentioned earlier 
when you were hiring a personal trainer 
CEO of your health &quot;pick me! Pick me! Pick me!&quot;
All over the place, right? I&#39;m dealing with 
the same things. What do you do 
to prevent the people from coming into 
your circle who are there as basically brand parasites, they want to be there for
three months, six months, say &quot;hey, I worked for Gary V.!&quot; and then go out and 
build their own brand and probably steal 
half your shit. How do you get around that? - So, first of all, 
I get around it by not being crippled by it. So I&#39;m just not 
worried about it. It&#39;s a cost of entry 
and it&#39;s a byproduct, and I&#39;m actually flattered by it to be very frank with you. So mentally that&#39;s where I&#39;m at. Number two, I&#39;m never
worried about stealing. It&#39;s interesting that you
brought that up. I try to give away all
my shit all the time. Like to me, 
one thing I&#39;ve learned, is that 99% of people 
won&#39;t do anything with your information anyway.
(crowd murmuring) It&#39;s all execution and especially what 
I do for a living, I&#39;m trying to figure out
new platforms of attention quicker and better 
than the market, so -- I mean, by the way,
pre-rolled YouTube video. There&#39;s 9 years of content
of me saying it&#39;s shit except six months ago 
Google changed it and now you can target
people&#39;s Google search behavior in pre-roll video and all
of a sudden it&#39;s fucking good because I know exactly
what your intent is. I don&#39;t give a crap about
Google&#39;s bullshit demographics, no longer am I crippled 
by &quot;are you really &quot;a 33 year old African
American female in Houston?&quot; I don&#39;t give a shit. 
I know that you searched the Houston Rockets so 
I got what I need, right? So you know, the truth is
I&#39;ve got it in a mental box where I understand.
The one that&#39;s probably bothered me the most is
&quot;Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook&quot;. I wrote a book called
&quot;Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook&quot; give give give, and then ask. Unfortunately, so many
think it&#39;s give give give and then take. Even
more scary, I don&#39;t like when I watch people give
me things I don&#39;t want and then expect me 
to give them things and then be like, &quot;What up, bro?
&#39;Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook?&#39;&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck you dude.&quot; (crowd laughs) I didn&#39;t want you to send
me your bullshit t-shirt. I don&#39;t consider your
fuckin&#39; piece of shit t-shirt a jab dickface. (laughter) So, I would say, look, and I think more 
importantly I&#39;ll give you one other slight tweak
that I actually think is more helpful than
anything else I&#39;ve said here, and this will help 
a lot of you I hope. Because it&#39;s been huge for me: it&#39;s never the hiring. Too many people here
are crippled by hiring and making the right call,
it&#39;s about the firing. So if you&#39;re gonna let
somebody into your inner circle don&#39;t worry about what
their intentions are, if they&#39;re full of shit, 
once they get in if you can taste it,
get &#39;em out. Got it? - [Dave] Thank you.
- You got it, brother. - [Dev] Hey Gary.
- Hey, man. - [Dev] My name&#39;s Dev, 
I&#39;m a search guy, and I wanted to ask what
are some of the keys to new business 
growth at VaynerMedia? You guys scaled immensely
fast over the years up to a hundred mil, right? So what were some of the
keys that basically led to growth of new business? - The pillars that 
got us there were, number one culture internally. I&#39;m a big fan of 
B and C players. I&#39;m gonna give 
you a lot of things, like the hiring and the firing, another one that I think has that same ethos is that
I&#39;m actually very fond of average players on your team. If you go for scale. 
If you&#39;re gonna build a four person company,
y&#39;all have to be ninjas. I get it. But if you&#39;re building
a 700 person company, you don&#39;t have 700 As. As a matter of fact, if
you really break it down, anybody that works for
someone else isn&#39;t like you. There was no me working for you. So number one, 
it was the acceptance of not being crippled. 
First, hiring ultra-fast -- ugh. The hiring process 
at VaynerMedia is, &quot;Are you alive? You&#39;re hired!&quot;
You know? (crowd laughs) The truth is, it got a
little bit better than that when I got out of the equation. But when I hired 
employee 30 to a buck 50, people barely got 
off the elevator and I was like, 
&quot;Here&#39;s your punch card.&quot; A lot of the early 
people knew who I was, and they thought 
it might be hard -- I mean they couldn&#39;t believe it. I was like, &quot;You like sports?&quot; &quot;Nah.&quot; You&#39;re hired!
(crowd laughs) It was just whatever because
I realized we were growing. And here is something very
interesting: one thing that you have to
understand is, you can&#39;t be the judge and
the jury for the market. One of the reasons I grew it so
fast was we were so ahead of the market
with social media marketing and strategy that even if
they were B and C players, I knew they were A players to
the market. So my B and C could walk
into Campbell&#39;s Soup and seem like a super A. So I think one of the things is if you&#39;re great at search, what you need to understand
is who you&#39;re selling to may not be as great as you are. And please, I wanna make
sure I&#39;m being very, this is what&#39;s great about
having time to give these 
detailed answers, I&#39;m not talking about selling
stuff you don&#39;t believe in. You gotta understand 
a lot of people, you know what&#39;s funny?
I had a lot of &quot;no&quot; men and &quot;no&quot; women around me. For somebody&#39;s so hyperbolized, I like people who will
push back against me. I need the context. So a
lot of them pushed very hard in 2010 and &#39;11 of, like,
&quot;Gary, what&#39;s the--&quot; right in my team, like
does this mean anything? Does this help the client? And I educate him, like look,
and this was before there was paid social that could drive the
business results we have now so it was very organic, I go,
&quot;look, &quot;here&#39;s what you 
have to understand. &quot;They&#39;re paying us 
$5,000 dollars a month &quot;for the amount of content
and strategy we&#39;re giving them &quot;and just the IP for
60,000 a year is a gift &quot;for these companies. &quot;They&#39;re paying 
$5,000 dollars right now &quot;for the catering bill on
their bullshit commercial.&quot; So it&#39;s about contextualizing. One was the culture, keep continuity. The amount of people I have, our voluntary turnover 
rate is 75-100, like it&#39;s unbelievably
better than the market. Two, it was my 
brand leadership as a, I mean, I had a real,
what do you mean I had, I have a real fuckin&#39; racket. I get paid $100,000
dollars to go and speak and then land million dollar
accounts. That&#39;s fucking good, you know?
(crowd laughs) You know what I mean? It was funny, 
I saw you shaking your head to some stuff right now.
I always pay attention to who&#39;s vibing with 
me when I speak, and I use their positive energy to keep my momentum going. This one Toyota talk,
small group this size, it was just one 
guy giving me vibes. Mentally, I&#39;m like 
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go thank &quot;that guy after this talk.&quot; Guy ends up being the
fucking CMO of Toyota. This was a dealership, like,
northeast steelers, you know? The speaking, my brand. And then finally, and this
will always be tried and true, as charismatic and 
as cool as I am, as much as 
we have continuity, there is no 100 million dollars,
there is no 30 to 650 people three-to-100 million 
revenue in four years without doing good work. So
the biggest growth we had, the biggest, was somebody at 
Pepsi being blown, Lipton, Brisk Ice Tea,
South By Southwest 2009. Seven weeks after 
Instagram came out, we made Instagram 
cans for Brisk Ice Tea for South By Southwest, it got them a lot of
press, Instagram blew up, that guy left and 
went to Mondelez and hired us, right? In corporate America people
are leaving and going to different companies 
and hiring us -- the key to our 
growth was word of mouth of our good work when people
went to other companies. Yeah. You got it, brother. - [Man 2] Hey man. - Hey man. - [Man 2] Family 
question for you, I&#39;m not sure if 
Mark has asked you this at the Social Media and
Marketing World or not. But I know you&#39;re really
good about keeping weekends to yourself. - Yes. - [Man 2] Four or 
five years from now, your kid says, 
&quot;Hey Dad, you&#39;re not around &quot;as much as I&#39;d like you to be.&quot; - I&#39;m super scared of this
conversation, by the way. (audience laughter) I&#39;m being dead serious. - [Man 2] Yeah, 
I am too, I mean, our kids are the same age and-- - Keep going. - [Man 2] What, you know, 
does it change the plans-- - I don&#39;t know. - [Man 2] To buy the Jets, 
does it-- - One thing, I was super
excited about being here because when I get to do long
Q and A with a lot of people that have some sense of who 
I am and there&#39;s a high caliber of individuals, A, I&#39;m never
interested in bullshitting, B, I think I&#39;m even at a
heightened degree of not wanting to bullshit, 
if that makes any sense. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. Like I am not interested
in lying about this issue. One of the things I think
some of you have noticed, is I&#39;m starting to talk
about suicide and depression in entrepreneur 
land &#39;cause it&#39;s real. A lot of, most especially
looking at this room, at the age group that a
lot of us are in this room, there&#39;s less fake entrepreneurs
here than when I go to the Y Combinator
event in a couple months. Like, it has become such
a popular thing to sell. There are so many 22, 23,
24-year-olds that are truly not entrepreneurs that
are being entrepreneurs &#39;cause it&#39;s the 
cool thing to do and what it&#39;s leading to, 
and the cliche, and this is of course
generalization, but the thing that I&#39;ve
seen because I&#39;m very in it right now is a lot
of the 24-year-olds that are in 
entrepreneurship are the people that can raise, you know, 
$3 million or $1 million to do it and a lot of those people
are rich, white dudes. Okay? And the cliche thing with a
lot of these rich white kids that are 22, 23, 24 starting
these internet companies is, they grew up 
in a private school. They went to a big time college. Mom and Dad facilitated
a lot and the first time they&#39;ve ever dealt
with any true meritocracy or market conditions is the
day their app hits the market and the market says, &quot;Go fuck
yourself,&quot; almost every time. (audience laughter) And it&#39;s this, we have, and
a lot of you are parents, or are gonna be parents. We have an absolute wrong
game right now in our culture in America, by the way, this
happens to every empire. This is what&#39;s happening to us. It&#39;s black and white. We are in the eighth place
trophy business right now. We just are. We&#39;re rewarding 
kids because we think, we&#39;re doing fake self esteem. It&#39;s the politically 
correct thing to do. And my wife knows, I don&#39;t
give a fuck about anything when it comes to what the
kids are doing in school but when they go and 
do camp or sports, no eighth place trophies. Like, my little guy Xander,
he&#39;s got a little basket in our apartment, he has never
made a single basket on me, nor will he until he&#39;s 
15 or 16 years old. (laughter) I&#39;m being dead serious. Because it&#39;s not life. It&#39;s just not life. (laughter) (applause) It&#39;s true, it&#39;s true, 
he will never score. He&#39;s got a weird 
complex already about it. And so, I think that we&#39;re living through a very
interesting time right now of depression and suicide. There&#39;s been three suicides
in the tech ecosystem, the hardcore tech 
ecosystem that we know and nobody talks about it
and we need to talk about it. And there&#39;s a lack of
self-awareness right now in the game and 
I&#39;m worried about it. And I forgot about the
question because I was wrapping that back to something. What was it again? Oh, if they say, so on that, I think you&#39;ve got 
to talk real truths and so I don&#39;t want to bullshit. If my kids say that, 
I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what 
I&#39;m going to tell them. I know that I was a lot more
scared of it a year or two ago until I realized that, (laughs) this is just so fucking real. Oh, I&#39;m getting to a wealth
level where I&#39;d be able to grab my kids from school
on Friday and fly private somewhere for 
three days with them. I actually am so curious
if I&#39;m going to get caught in the middle. I do believe, and I&#39;ve
watched very carefully, that there&#39;s a financial
arbitrage level where you can buy time at
such an incredible pace that you might be 
able to sell it back to that time together. Know one thing, I haven&#39;t missed a recital
or an important school event for my first grade daughter yet. You know. If I&#39;m in New York, which means, luckily I&#39;m not traveling 
300 days a week. I&#39;ve missed stuff but I&#39;ll never miss it
if it&#39;s controllable and the other thing
I&#39;m very fascinated by is a lot of my friends
spend time with their kids but they&#39;re not spending
time with their kids. So like, a lot of my
buddies are absolutely like, will razz me, and then I&#39;ll
razz them back and be like, &quot;Dude, I was over at
your house the other day. &quot;You&#39;re not with you,
you play Call of Duty &quot;when you get home from work.&quot; Like, you&#39;re not with your kids. Listen, I&#39;m going 
to say another thing. There&#39;s a couple things that
I&#39;m absolutely adamant about. I will never give you, 
I will never judge, forget about give you, 
I think we all like to spew a little advice. I will never judge 
somebody&#39;s relationship or how they parent. I&#39;m the by-product 
of immigrant parents, where I didn&#39;t even see my
dad until I was 15 years old and he&#39;s my best bud. We have the greatest
relationships of all time. So, of course I&#39;m 
effected by that, right? Of course I&#39;m effected by,
&quot;Shit, my dad got away with.&quot; But I&#39;m also 
not taking for granted that my kids are wired
the same way that I was. I think it&#39;s an 
always moving thing. So, I don&#39;t know, man, I don&#39;t
know what I&#39;m going to do. But I really,
I just know my truth which is if I&#39;m not happy,
then everything else breaks, and if it makes me 
unhappy not to hustle, and do my thing, 
that&#39;s a vulnerability. And that&#39;s a real 
truth that people don&#39;t want to say out loud. Which is, I know what the
politically correct thing to say here is, I know what
everybody wants to say, but I&#39;m suffocated not being me. I&#39;m suffocated not being me. And my kids are way
worse off if I&#39;m unhappy than being happy, and so, 
I don&#39;t want to let them down. I&#39;m pretty, I&#39;m already, listen, I&#39;m taking seven
weeks vacation a year and it&#39;s hardcore quality
time in that seven weeks. And then with weekends,
I actually weirdly think I need to work more. I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck, there&#39;s 
two days a week.&quot; I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m concerned about it
because I don&#39;t know my kids well enough yet, right? I don&#39;t know where, 
like I know the way Lizzy and I are building
them and I&#39;m hoping with the DNA that they have, that they&#39;re going to be
extremely self confident and self worth and a lot
of those kind of things that will keep them into
a place where that won&#39;t be as much of an issue or
concern or their worth won&#39;t be wrapped 
up in my behavior. And I mean that. Like, one of the things
that my wife and I share, and it&#39;s probably the
foundation of our love affair with each other is we
don&#39;t fucking give a fuck about what anybody thinks,
including each other, think about each other. (audience laughter) I came home the other day. I was like, &quot;Liz, you have to
tell me about your side dude. &quot;Because you really 
don&#39;t give a fuck.&quot; If I texted Lizzy 
right now and was like, &quot;Hey, ran into Jordan and
Dan and John at this event &quot;and we&#39;re going to go
to Korea for nine months &quot;to work on this new startup.&quot; She would literally text
back in like two minutes and be like, &quot;Do you 
want me to pack?&quot; Like it&#39;s unbelievable 
to me how much she&#39;s an enabler 
of my behavior. (audience laughter) I mean it, I mean it. And she does her thing
and so, I don&#39;t know. And it&#39;s the most interesting
variable in my life but I&#39;m convinced 
that I will never go as far as 
&quot;the market wants me to,&quot; because I know myself too
well and I just won&#39;t be happy if I can&#39;t do me. (applause) - [Char] Hey Gary, it&#39;s Char. It&#39;s just a question
related back to your point about nostalgia being 
really underrated. - Yes. - [Char] And then bringing that
back into some of the new social media platforms and
I wonder what your view is about voice coming back? So apps like Anchor which
I think, personally, are really interesting
particularly for-- - Me too. - [Char] For a different 
demographic, so I&#39;d love to know what you think about-- - The problem with
voice, and I love voice, and I love Anchor, I&#39;ve been
watching it very carefully as I know you know. It takes too much time. We like time more than context. So why voice is incredible is, do you know how many times
you misinterpreted a Tweet or an email? A fuckload. &#39;Cause tone is lost in writing. What Voice does incredibly
well is you won&#39;t lose it because that&#39;s just 
something we know. The problem is, I have
no interest in listening to anybody&#39;s Anchor here
because it takes too much time. That&#39;s the problem. So, I&#39;m bullish on voice. I mean, from 2008, &#39;9,
&#39;10, &#39;11, I was like, &quot;Ooh, voice Twitter, 
voice Twitter.&quot; Anchor is the first voice
Twitter that I&#39;ve seen. Problem is it 
takes too much time and time is becoming, like
every second that goes by, time is becoming more valuable. Like we are willing to pay
unbelievable amounts of money to buy time. Uber&#39;s built on it. Uber sells time. Uber sells the 
perception of time. Like you think the car, 
in New York City, the amount of times 
I have an Uber coming and just watch cab after
cab after cab drive by. (audience laughter) I&#39;m like, &quot;This fucking blows.&quot; You know, so. Time is, I would tell
you that if you&#39;re hungry to actually build a start
up, I tell everybody to build time apps. 100%. Anything that sells you time. That&#39;s why the Postmates
and the same day deliveries and all that stuff, time. - [Alex] Hey Gary, 
Alex Icon on Snapchat. Thanks for selling 
me on Snapchat. - You got it, brother. - [Alex] Yeah, the question 
I want to ask, you talked earlier 
about leveraging Vayner into buying businesses. - Yes. - [Alex] So when are you
going to go all-in on that and what are the businesses
you&#39;re going to start with? - I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what businesses
I&#39;m going to start with. I&#39;ve been looking at deals
for the last 18 months. I even got into 
one letter of intent but I didn&#39;t like the
way the numbers looked. So first of all, 
number one rule is, it had to be big at one
point and it&#39;s not right now. Right? So, Bubblicious Bubble Gum, did $128 million in revenue 13 years ago, 17 years ago,
now it does seven, right? So there&#39;s a lot of 
things like that. Like Green Giant food
sold not too long ago. Fila, remember Fila, for
all you hip hop heads and Grant Hill fans, it was
big for 48 seconds, right? Like Z. Cavaricci pants, John. (audience laughter) It had to have brand 
for a certain time. By the way, this is how
the toy business works. Like, My Little Pony,
for anybody&#39;s who&#39;s 40, like I am, or in 
that general range, if you go in the toy aisle
now, it&#39;s our toy aisle because we&#39;re parents now
and we&#39;ll be nostalgic and we want our kids to play
with Strawberry Shortcake and GI Joe and Star Wars and
My Little Pony and dadadada. So, it has to be underpriced, had to have a lot of revenue,
and my preference would be that it would skew 
very strong 13 to 30 because my marketing
behavior usually starts there and it&#39;s underpriced there. So any brand that 
you want to sell to, if you want to sell
something to an 18-year-old in America today and you
don&#39;t spend 90% of your money and energy on Snapchat and
Instagram, you&#39;re an idiot. That&#39;s where their attention is. And that stuff 
is always underpriced. Snapchat and 
Instagram influencers and Snapchat marketing are underpriced, grossly
underpriced right now. The way search was 
grossly underpriced when I started doing it in 2001. And there&#39;s long 
tailed search SEM&#39;s that are underpriced by the
word wine is not five cents a click any more. And Facebook advertising 
24 months ago was the greatest steal in
the market when I was yelling about it and everybody was
like, &quot;No, they took away our,&quot; everybody got romantic. They took away 
our organic reach. Who gives a fuck? They took away your organic
reach and they give you the best ad product that
ever existed in return. Same thing right now,
you&#39;re debating Snapchat. It&#39;s a fad, dadadada. And then in 24 months
you&#39;re going to be on it and you&#39;re going not 
land grab as much, it&#39;s going to be harder 
to build fanbase. It&#39;s going to get noisy. The early users are 
going to stop buying. It&#39;s just the same fucking
pattern recognition forever. You got it. - [Cole] Hey Gary, Cole. - Cole, what&#39;s up, man?
- [Cole] What&#39;s up? Quick first question for your
fund, the $50 to 70 million? - Yeah? - Is it open to 
outside investors and what&#39;s the maximum 
offer or buy in? - So yeah, we still 
haven&#39;t closed. The minimum is a $2 million
check and super happy to talk to you about it. - [Cole] Perfect, thank you. Bigger, sorry, 
that was just real quick. Bigger question, was
talking to Yanik today and you know about 
Thrive where he spoke, what do you think about
someone who&#39;s in a startup including a social element
or a give like a Tom&#39;s Shoes in the startups today 
for the millennials that seem to be, and again,
what Yanik was citing today, research that they&#39;re more
inclined to buy from someone that makes
a difference than someone that&#39;s just making a profit. - Yanik&#39;s right. The problem is 
marketers ruin everything. (audience laughter) So what&#39;s happened is, 
my data shows, and what I&#39;m looking at is
that the trend is already swung the other direction. You know, Yanik, I don&#39;t know
what, if you look at the data but I think what&#39;s happened is, there was probably three
months there a year ago, where every startup, and 
I look at seven to 25 startups a week because I invest, 
came in and said, &quot;Gary, Gary, I got it, 
all right, listen. &quot;I have an umbrella company. &quot;It&#39;s an umbrella and for
every umbrella you buy, &quot;we give an umbrella to
some poor dude in Seattle.&quot; (audience laughter) You know like, and 
so what happened was, when Tom&#39;s Shoes did it, and
when a couple of the early people did it, it was novel. It caught our attention. Yes, the younger set does
care more about charity and giving and, 
you know, no question. They&#39;re wired differently. The problem is, 
it became a tactic. Every scum bucket 
marketer that I know started a startup that had
a buy one get one, give one, and it became tactical and
now there&#39;s 8,000 of them out there and 
now it&#39;s just noise. It&#39;s the same old game. Supply and demand and so, 
I think there&#39;s an opportunity. The problem is 
where&#39;s the intent? So many people now do
it because they think it&#39;s the hook for their
business to succeed, not because they actually
give a fuck about curing a disease or helping somebody
in an underprivileged environment and when your
intent is fucked, you lost. And that&#39;s real and 
you guys know it. And you also know that
you&#39;ve done many things where your intent was
wrong, it was tactical, and it never wins. So, if your intent&#39;s, 
what&#39;s that? - [Man 3] Amen. - Amen, brother, thank you. It&#39;s true and so, I think
can somebody tomorrow start a company that&#39;s
buy and give and win? Absolutely, if it&#39;s their truth. A, it&#39;s harder to break through 
because there&#39;s so much shit, and B, unfortunately
there&#39;s just not so many people that have that truth. - [Man 4] Hey, 
it&#39;s me again. - Does he get more air time? Strategy. - [Man 4] This is a 
prediction because I know you like to be right about shit. Do you think Snapchat
will add at any point in the near future something
for sort of endemic discovery rather than having to push
people from other networks? - I don&#39;t know. And I do like to predict,
and I feel comfortable. The reason is, 
Evan&#39;s done so many things. I don&#39;t know Evan well enough
to know what he&#39;s going to do. What I do think is that
Snapchat&#39;s gonna do something very smart in
the way they&#39;re doing the stories thing. How many people here actually
like Snapchat and use it as a human? Like, not as a marketer, 
that&#39;s me. I mean, as a human you like it. So you notice how they went
with continuous stories, I think they&#39;re going to
do a very smart ad product in between people. So that&#39;s what 
I think they&#39;ve set up. That I&#39;ll predict. I think there was
no reason to do it except the continuous
content gets stopped. And I think it&#39;s 
really cool if you go, if you really think of data,
think about, you follow GaryVee and 
Tim Ferris, and you can actually buy an ad in between 
those two people. You can buy an ad between
Kim Kardashian and Toyota. Like, you&#39;ll have the data to
know what the continuation is and you can insert 
a five or 10 in there. I think if you could do
that, boy, I would buy the shit out of that 
if I actually knew the two media entities,
I would just understand who that person was and
what they were interested in and be able to create and
sell in that environment. - [Man 5] Two questions, 
three questions left. - No, we could 
do a little bit more. I&#39;m going to try 
to be late for my call. This is too fun. (audience laughing) - [Diana] Hey Gary,
Diana here. - How are you? - [Diana] I&#39;m great, 
how are you? - Good. - [Diana] So if Snapchat&#39;s 
on this side, I kind of see 
meditation on this side. - Okay. - [Diana] I know you&#39;re
very kind of futuristic and have made 
quite a few predictions-- - I have. - [Diana] On the 
meditation side. - Obsessed. - [Diana] I&#39;m really curious. How do you see meditation
playing out as a consumable in the marketplace? Is it events?
- Yes. - [Diana] Is it online?
- Yes. - [Diana] Everything.
- Yes. Meditation is the fitness
industry over the last 20 years. - [Diana] That&#39;s you
think it&#39;s going to be. - Meditation in 20 years
is a foundational pillar in American consumer society. Mental health is the 
next physical health. Everybody here in 
20 years will have some, there&#39;ll be the 
lightweight version of it, like oh, there&#39;s some cool
little app and it just makes me sleep better or escape,
and then there&#39;ll be more extreme stuff. And the truth is, just so
everybody knows, and I appreciate 
you knowing that, and people that follow me. I know really nothing about it. I just know consumer behavior
and I know when I see the tea leaves, I just
know it is going to be, there is, I&#39;m 100% positive that the next retail explosion, like that looks like Soul Cycle 
or like Blockbuster Video is going to be, there is
going to be a Starbucks and Soul Cycle of meditation. The place that every trendy
rich cool person goes to and sits there. (audience laughter) So I think, think about it as
every other genre that pops. So there&#39;ll be the
Starbucks and Soul Cycle, there&#39;ll be you 
have UFC fighting, there was the 
merchandise company, they&#39;ll be the Tap Out 
or the Life is Good. There&#39;ll be a brand that owns
the meditation swag, right? And then there&#39;s going to
be all the other things. I think it&#39;s going to be big. Like, as a matter of fact,
you guys heard earlier, the $50 to $75 million 
10 companies, one of them will be a
major bet on meditation. I don&#39;t know what but I will. E Sports, VR B2B, I think virtual 
reality&#39;s being sold as a consumer 
thing way to early. It feels like Internet &#39;91, &#39;92. So I think it&#39;s way to early
but much like in &#39;91, &#39;92, the people that made money
were like the infrastructure of the internet itself. I&#39;m very hot on 
virtual reality B2B. I&#39;m very hot on meditation. I&#39;m very hot on e-sports
and I&#39;m very hot on fully integrated direct to 
consumer products. - Yeah, hey man. - [Chris] Thanks for 
being here tonight. Chris Caplin. The stump question for you tonight was around 
your children. - Yes. - [Chris] So, I have a 10 year
old girl who&#39;s going on 25 and a 12 year old boy who
I just gave an iPhone 6 to without a data plan. But wants a Snapchat account, has an Instagram account. And what are your thoughts
and ideas on our youth and their just obsession
with social media? - [Chris] I know it&#39;s inevitable and I want them 
to be a part of it &#39;cause they teach 
me to be a part of it but how do I-- I don&#39;t want to be a
helicopter parent either. How do we control 
the 4,000 fucking passive aggressive 
assholes out there who tell my child
horrible, horrible things? - Right, they&#39;re fat, or ugly,
or what-- So a couple things. One, I truly believe the way that we always 
solve every problem is the religion not the tactic, back to the question 
about fitness, so I think that if you&#39;ve
been able to instill the right pillars into
your child, you win. Like, it&#39;s unbelievable
how much peer pressure wasn&#39;t able to penetrate me because of what my parents 
did in building that self esteem and things of that nature. Look, this is evolution. Like, you know, 
when I was a kid, girls that got second phone
lines, that was gonna ruin them. Like they were 
gonna lay in their room and be on the phone all day. Or Zelda was gonna 
fucking make me like not capable of
being a human in society. (audience laughs) Like, you know, 
whether it was video games or whether it was punk music
or rock and roll in the 70&#39;s or whether it was 
Elvis shaking his hips. Like, I mean, what 
Miley Cyrus did four years ago on the MTV Music Awards that
got everybody freaked out, is tame on Instagram. Like, evolution. And so I think you&#39;ve got to instill good principles 
into your kids. It&#39;s unbelievable how many parents have come 
to me and said, &quot;I&#39;m not letting my 
son on Snapchat.&quot; Right, because they&#39;re 
scared of sexting, because that was the
headline for Snapchat. Meanwhile, like, &quot;Does your
son have a phone?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Does he have the 
internet on his phone?&quot; (audience laughter)
&quot;Yes.&quot; I&#39;m like, you know he can go
to jizzhut.com pretty easily. (audience laughter) You know so, I think that-- I promise you, 
that&#39;s far more dangerous of what you&#39;re scared of, than the random 12 year old
floozy chick in science class. (audience laughter) I think the way you solve
everything, by the way, is communication. And I think a lot of parents
are scared to have real talk. And so I think you 
have conversation. And look, a 10-year-old 
and a 12-year-old is still a 10 and 12-year-old. You have to be observant, but it&#39;s gonna be what 
it&#39;s gonna be, man. Listen, the funny thing is, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because
I like so don&#39;t want to die and stay so 
grounded to my youth. Or because I&#39;m in this stuff. I&#39;m sure you guys all
feel the same way, like, we were just there. Like I was just in sixth
grade spending four months trying to figure out how to
steal Playboy&#39;s from 7-11 with my buddies. You know, it was just 
two minutes ago. So like this-- I think we love our kids
so much, we go on defense. It&#39;s the way people 
run their business. When something gets
good they go to defense. And that&#39;s the 
second they start losing. And so I understand why, and I feel those things too, but it is what it is. Conversations and instilling
the right things into them. And my big thing actually, is more I&#39;m gonna watch
my kids to make sure they&#39;re not the kids that
are doing the bad stuff to other kids more so like-- I want them to feel the adver-- I&#39;m actually okay with
getting their feelings hurt and things of that nature. I want to have those
conversations. But like this obsession
with protecting our kids from getting their feelings
hurt is a little too far. Like I want Xander to get
punched in the fucking mouth. (audience laughs timidly) I do! I do! (audience laughter) I think it&#39;d be good for him. He&#39;s just a rich kid
from the Upper East Side. Fuck, he needs a good beating. - [Man 6] Hey Gary. So often I work with
a lot of entrepreneurs and successful 
different people and stuff. And it&#39;s not always
but more often than not there&#39;s a cost often. Kind of they&#39;re 
unaware of the cost that the brand 
building has created. So while you&#39;ve been crushing it and I use that term obviously
because of your book. And with respect 
I&#39;ve read your book and I kind of hated the book because it showed me 
how to do something I was scared shitless to
do in such a simple way. And I&#39;ll never forget the
day I posted my first video, and thanks for making me look like a total asshole 
in the world. Because I tell you, I put this
video out and it was so bad. But I was so scared and you simplified the
whole process for me. And it&#39;s gone on to 
do different things, and I&#39;m very grateful for that. But I work with a lot of
very interesting people who often have a lot of success and I was gonna say, to
be politically correct, there&#39;s oft sometimes 
not a cost, but the reality is, almost
every time there is a cost. - There&#39;s always a cost. - [Man 6] I&#39;m just wondering, and I&#39;m not trying 
to expose you, but I&#39;m just wondering
from your point of view if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing
a degree of that cost or you know if there is
a cost in your point. - I mean, the cost is-- There&#39;s a lot-- I actually, when I really
think about your question, the biggest cost 
I&#39;m worried about is if actually 
I do something wrong. So for the most part, I don&#39;t do anything wrong
by our standards in society and I&#39;m scared that I&#39;ve
done such a great job of building, to the 
people that know me, a very good thing, that I&#39;m scared of like-- I always think, like
what could slip me up? I think about that a lot. As far as to answer
your question directly, what&#39;s been the cost? Well, leisure. You know like, it&#39;s fun
to like do fun stuff and like I don&#39;t 
remember the last time that I was fundamentally
completely calm. (audience laughter) Let me explain what I mean. Everything&#39;s on me. My whole family, my brother,
my two brother-in-law&#39;s, my brother, my parents, my sis-- everybody&#39;s livelihood at
this point, and lifestyle, is on my shoulders. The whole kit and caboodle. Like that&#39;s called pressure. And then if you really like
are wired the way I am, I genuinely care about the
people that are in my ecosystem. Even the people that
are like employee 432, I feel pressure. I feel pressure, so the
biggest cost I think is peace. Like when you&#39;re the one, 
you know like, this whole notion of like
being the entrepreneur, I don&#39;t know-- And I see a lot of you 
shaking your head, like you guys, 
you gals know, it&#39;s on you. It&#39;s super fun to be number two. Like I always bust AJ&#39;s chops, I&#39;m like, &quot;you&#39;ve got the
fucking gig.&quot; Because like when the
whole thing&#39;s on fire, like you still can go,
&quot;What are we gonna do?&quot; (audience laughter) - [Man 7] That&#39;s true. - Right? For me I think the
biggest thing I gave up was like it-- it&#39;s very-- And I&#39;m doing it right now-- Man, it&#39;s been you know,
eighth grade, ninth grade, it&#39;s been a long time
when I didn&#39;t recognize that not only my life but
pretty much everybody else I gave a fuck 
about in the world, was predicated 
on my behavior, period. Like for real. So peace of mind and like &quot;ahh.&quot; That is just, you give that up. And I&#39;ve given up a ton. I mean, the first five
years of my marriage is one of the great 
regrets of my life. Like because I was 
hustling so much. I easily and should&#39;ve
and desperately wish that I went on two more
weeks vacation with Lizzie to Paris and Japan and
just ate sushi for a week. Like, and I didn&#39;t. And I don&#39;t get it back. And so it makes me very
conscious of the kid stuff and so I&#39;ve learned 
from that behavior and I&#39;ve been much 
better with the kids. Seven weeks vacation, still. I don&#39;t even like 
saying it out loud. And there&#39;s other things. Friendships. There&#39;s a lot of good 
friends that I have from high school and college that I don&#39;t have a
relationship with anymore that would have been
very fruitful in my life that are just gone. Pressure&#39;s tough man. Right? But for me and for a
lot of people in here, there&#39;s just no other gear. You&#39;re just, 
your destiny&#39;s your destiny. So I&#39;m not naive, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s 
so great being me. I really don&#39;t. I love being me, but I recognize why me
is not great on paper. Like I truly believe that
there&#39;s a much sweeter spot in our society than 
the one I sit with. I romance it as the guy or
girl that makes like 347 a year as a solid exec, has a
ridiculous work-life balance, goes to every fucking 
little league game, has four weeks vac-- Like you know. But I just don&#39;t know that gear. I don&#39;t have that. - [Man 7] Sorry. Do you think 
that people like you exist to pull people into the gear or the middle 
ground where they can-- - [Gary] I&#39;m sorry? - [Man 7] Do you think 
people like you need to exist in the world
to pull people into a space where they can have a
bit more peace of mind? In other words, that you
pay a price for that. And this is a very 
personal question, because, despite the fact that
I&#39;m always in front of people and speaking or whatever, it&#39;s very, very extremely
lonely to do what I do. - It&#39;s the loneliest!
- [Man 7] Yeah. - Dude, there&#39;s nobody else. Like, if you&#39;re truly, truly
the number one of your thing, there&#39;s just, what else? Like, who? Where? Like I talk to no-- Do you know that I never
talk to my wife about work? (clicks tongue) Goose egg. And I think that 
the people in here that have that 
same thing, they realize, what are we gonna talk about? 99% of my day is fires. I&#39;m in the business 
of eating shit. (audience laughter) Do I really want to come
home and tell my wife that-- Like, I don&#39;t celebrate victory. Like, the biggest
vulnerability-- One of the weakest things, one of the things that I&#39;m
doing worst in my company is we are killing it and
we don&#39;t celebrate dick. Like we win an 
account like, &quot;yeah.&quot; We don&#39;t even talk-- Like, I don&#39;t know. All I do, all my energy
is spent on the negative. It&#39;s what I do. It&#39;s what you have to do. Because if you don&#39;t 
address it, it becomes cancer, and becomes your vulnerability. And so, I get it, brother. I think there&#39;s a huge
price to pay, you know? A huge price to pay. But I would not have 
it any other way. I&#39;m happy as shit. Because I&#39;m living the
game that I was built for. But this is why I&#39;m so
scared of the reverse. I&#39;m scared of the people, the cliché thing is everybody
right now at Princeton who five to seven years ago would have went 
to Bain and McKinsey, made a lot of money, met another attractive smart
person at Bain and McKinsey, married them, bought a
second home in the Hampton&#39;s because one made 
740 at fucking Goldman and one made 297 at this. That same fucking person
today is starting a start-up and has the Uber for maids. (audience laughter) And is gonna lose. Is gonna lose. Is gonna take a three
to six year set back. Is gonna lose equity 
in their ecosystem. Is gonna have a 
bruised confidence. Because they weren&#39;t-- I&#39;m, as an entrepreneur, 
as a one, I only want to lose. Like, losing is comfortable. Losing&#39;s delicious. That&#39;s why I love 
being a Jets fan. You know, like-- (audience laughter) So, I&#39;m worried actually, it&#39;s so funny who I&#39;m trying
to talk to these days, is the people that aren&#39;t
built for what you and I know. Because it&#39;s super glamorous. This is why I&#39;m visceral to
what&#39;s going on on Instagram. And you&#39;ve been 
hearing me talk about the bullshit 
entrepreneurs who rent! Rent watches, planes, girls, baby giraffes, (audience laughter) and then sell people 
on how they got it because they 
allude to they having it, versus renting it, and then selling bullshit and they&#39;re selling
entrepreneurship that that is not what
entrepreneurship is. It&#39;s just not. (applause) Keep going. I think we&#39;re getting somewhere. (audience laughter) Thank you, brother. - [Steve] Hi Gary, I&#39;m Steve. I&#39;m a behavioral profiler. (audience laughter) I don&#39;t wanna ask a question as much as I want 
to make a statement. - Okay. - We need you 
just the way you are. Now, I know there&#39;s a
lot of questions probably in some peoples heads in
here about your style, the way you do things, but you&#39;re basically 
created this way and there&#39;s people in this world that wouldn&#39;t do shit if it
wasn&#39;t for people like you. And so I just want to
encourage you in the fact that you know you&#39;re thinking
about your fatherhood and your husbandry and all
these different things. But they hooked up with
you being the way you are. - I get it man. - [Steve] And that&#39;s you and 
I want you to be proud of it. - [Gary] I am. - And I know that. - [Gary] I really am. - I just want to say that--
- I appreciate that - [Steve] for everybody else. - And, listen-- - This is who you are, you&#39;re
like a modern day prophet for the business world. And Elon Musk is another one. I mean, you&#39;re an anomaly. You&#39;re not normal. - Listen-- - [Steve] I say that because
there are social norms - [Gary] I get it. - You&#39;re so far outside 
of the social norm that you stand out, 
you become an anomaly, and everybody&#39;s 
freaked out at it. But it&#39;s who you are, 
it&#39;s what you are. And stay being that. - You know, my man, I think you&#39;ll find this interesting based 
on what you do, I&#39;m so in-tune to that, that I&#39;ve had very intense
conversations with my wife which is, people not 
having self-awareness or being blind to it. I know that the way I&#39;m wired is the cliché thing where there&#39;s that person
that&#39;s super famous and they die and then
like the country mourns and then the family goes, &quot;Yeah, but there 
weren&#39;t there for me.&quot; Like I&#39;m so conscious of that, I&#39;m so aware that I&#39;m for scale, that I know it comes at
the cost of those 10 people that I hack at it a lot because
I&#39;m trying to figure out like, &quot;boy do I know?&quot; And it&#39;s a crazy 
feeling to know it. Like it&#39;s a crazy feeling
to hear thanks for-- Like, I don&#39;t know. You know what else by the way? It&#39;s super easy for me not
to get caught up in it. Like, I didn&#39;t do anything. My mom and dad had sex
at the right second. Like, I didn&#39;t do anything. Like this is who I am. This has always been 
who I was, even-- It&#39;s so fun for me to
have my grammar school and middle school friends
pop up because of Facebook. They&#39;re telling me shit 
that I long forgot and it&#39;s just the same shit. Like there&#39;s something about
the way that I communicate that makes people see
it slightly different and then allows them to
do something with it. And so I&#39;m not 
running from it, I just-- If I can do anything to hack
not doing the cliché thing that happens to people like me, which is the people closest
to me lose the most, the people furthest away
from me win the most, I&#39;d like to at least do that. But other than that, I just don&#39;t even 
know how not to be me. - [Steve] (mumbles) - Well thank you.
(audience laughter) - [Melissa] So to that end, 
Melissa Lands of the Fresh 20, to that
end, I&#39;m a little nervous to ask this question in
a room full of HD men but, so, do you think that
there&#39;s room for women? Like what&#39;s your prediction
on women changing that dynamic and going
from the crush it economy to the live it economy and
kind of changing the dynamic of what it means to be a
successful entrepreneur? Do you think that women are
going to make that change in business or not important? - So I want to make 
sure I understand it. So, give me a 
little more detail. - [Melissa] So for most of the highly successful 
women entrepreneurs that I know, they&#39;re not
concerned about crushing it, they&#39;re concerned about living a holistic life so that you-- - You mean with children, 
go in detail. - [Melissa] No, 
not even children, just having a little 
bit more of a balance. Being more connected to
the people on the ground, to their friends, 
to their family. Like living in a way that
they don&#39;t have to make the sacrifices 
that you&#39;re making. - Yeah, look, I mean, 99% of
the dudes don&#39;t want to do what I&#39;m doing either. So, look, a couple things. One, boys and 
girls are different. - [Melissa] In what way? - [Gary] And so like, this has 
been a very interesting topic. VaynerMedia was built
on female leadership. I wrote the first check to
Birchbox after they had 50 no&#39;s. Like, I have a higher percentage
of female entrepreneurs in my ecosystem and 
I get all this credit and I feel terrible about
it because the reason I&#39;ve done these things is
I&#39;m actually prejudiced against dudes in a 
world where I think EQ, in a world where it
has been proven that EQ is not more 
favorable to a woman, I&#39;m being prejudiced to
guys that they can&#39;t be as EQ oriented as women, 
even though I am. So, what do I, 
I think it&#39;s first of all, look how far we&#39;ve come in
America on race and gender in 30, 40, 50 years. It&#39;s really good and 
there&#39;ll be more and I think that 
it&#39;s really cool. When it comes to business,
it&#39;s so sports for me, that you would be, 
like it&#39;s stunning to me how I cannot even 
wrap my head around even thinking of anything
other than the market. You know? Like I never would think,
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a Hispanic. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a transgender. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a Black dude. &quot;You&#39;re a girl.&quot; I would never think, 
I don&#39;t care. Can we win? Can you fucking sell shit? And so, I think that,
one, I think a lot about if I was exactly 
my way as a woman, how much would starting
a family pull at me from a chemical 
we&#39;re different game. I&#39;m fascinated by that,
just like in general. But I think that 
a lot of White males really, really, really worry
about what other people think of them and
they have it best. So I&#39;m very empathetic to
what a woman&#39;s going to think about what everybody
else thinks about them and I think that&#39;s holding
people back. Boy, girl, Black, White, more
than anything in the world and so I do think, 
I think that&#39;s the key to the question 
that you&#39;re asking. Once a person is capable of
really getting into a place where they&#39;re content 
with themselves and can, at a very high level,
not worry about the market&#39;s feedback to themselves, 
they can win. In whatever they want. And so, &quot;living it,&quot; 
first and foremost, is defined super
different by every person. And so, that&#39;s just 
how I see it. But it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s really
an interesting issue. It&#39;s a really interesting 
genre for me. My daughter is much more
similar to me than my son is. I can tell that already. And so, I want her to be, 
if she wants to, I want her to be number one
and I don&#39;t want anything to stop her but I also,
pretty interesting about this, and I say this to my minority
and female entrepreneurs, if one person, one, if
one person in the world that looks like you ever
achieved it, then you can too. Like, there&#39;s this big 
argument right now with a lot of my
female entrepreneurs. They&#39;re like, &quot;It&#39;s so 
hard to get money &quot;from White man VC&#39;s.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Getting VC
money is nothing compared &quot;to the market.&quot; (applause) The market&#39;s much
tougher than Dickhead Don on Sandhill Road. - [Melissa] But I think 
you misunderstand my question so 
I didn&#39;t do it right. - So let&#39;s do it. - [Melissa] My question&#39;s not 
about women equality because I think 
that I can do anything-- - Go ahead, go ahead. - [Melissa] That any man in this room can do.
- [Gary] Go ahead, yup. - [Melissa] And maybe better. My question is, do you think
that women business leaders are going to change the culture
from the crush it culture to-- - No. - [Melissa] No at all? - Nope. (audience laughter) - [Melissa] Awesome,
like it&#39;s interesting. Because we&#39;re living in this
world where our concerns are different. - I don&#39;t think the crush it
culture is really the culture. Really, I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just one of the
sub-cultures. There&#39;s much more momentum
for politically correct. Just so you know because a
lot of my content goes viral on Facebook, which by
the way, it&#39;s so funny, a lot of my content is going
quite, scaling quite well on Facebook, by the
way, here&#39;s the secret. Captioned videos. Do not put up another 
video on Facebook without captioning it. So there&#39;s a tactic for tonight. Anyway, my content is
dismantling it. Which is so funny 
because my paid team, my team sits next to me 
and I&#39;ll know because we&#39;re 
putting up content. We&#39;re very much in sports
culture, like yeah, they get excited, 
they&#39;re super pumped and I&#39;m super sad 
for a quick second &#39;cause I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck, here
comes seven million people &quot;that have never seen
me before so here comes &quot;the top 15 comments of
this guy&#39;s a fuckface.&quot; You know? (audience laughter) Here&#39;s why I brought that up. All of my content that&#39;s
&quot;crush it,&quot; that&#39;s winning, is viscerally getting 
pushed against. Like the top thing 
that everybody does, do you want to see your kids? This guy&#39;s going to die at 42. You know, like, I do not
think that crush it culture is the main culture right now. I think the work life
balance, politically correct, we&#39;re all going to
accomplish fucking everything and do everything 
balanced right game is the culture. And Bernie&#39;s very popular,
right? Go look at the data, I&#39;m
looking at it very carefully &#39;cause I don&#39;t want 
my head chopped off for being a capitalist. 16 to 24 year olds, for all
the entrepreneurs there are, there&#39;s a bunch of people that
think working hard is bad. Like capitalism is bad,
like you&#39;re in an ecosystem of a lot of winners, crush it,
we&#39;re going to fucking do it, but the macro, the macro, the thing 
has already changed. The thing&#39;s changed. America lost. Like just, I want everybody,
I don&#39;t know how much you get around, it&#39;s over. We&#39;ve had too many decades
and too many generations, you, me, we&#39;re the problem. Like just, it&#39;s not our faults. We were just born in the
generation of 200 years into our empire. We are soft. Soft. (applause) - [Man 8] Gary, you 
talked quite a bit today about self-awareness. How do you build and
sustain self-awareness? - I don&#39;t know. I hate this question because
fuck I really want to give a good answer and there&#39;s
people that do different things. Like, I don&#39;t feel like I have 
a grasp on how to teach self-awareness or maintain it. I know I have it. I know I rely on it. I know that there&#39;s people,
I&#39;ve seen people talk about how to do it. Like, I respect that 
that may be true, I&#39;ve never dug under the hood
or watched somebody do it. I have seen this and this is
something for a lot of you that are building 
things to think about. I have seen a lot of my people grow in their self-awareness out of the safety that I&#39;ve
created in the environment, in the culture of the
company and so within safety, they&#39;ve been able to expand
their emotional intelligence. But I don&#39;t know, man. But boy, let me tell you
something, for that gentleman, or whoever else, 
if you know how to do it, if there&#39;s a 
way to really do it, it&#39;s the drug. It is the game. It&#39;s unbelievable how
powerful it is if you have it. It just saves you. Makes you likable,
makes you like yourself. It makes you understand shit. The other thing, 
you&#39;ve got to understand, there&#39;s something that
comes along with it, there&#39;s a cousin of all
these feelings, empathy, is something I live on. Do you know that nobody&#39;s
ever let me down? If you really understood
why I&#39;m so damn happy, and I really am, it&#39;s because
nobody&#39;s ever let me down because I actually have
zero expectation of others. Like zero. Because I understand, I get it. I&#39;m empathetic. I understand, I get it. You couldn&#39;t, you shouldn&#39;t,
you weren&#39;t raised that way, you didn&#39;t see it, 
you didn&#39;t like, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sure but 
I can tell you this. If I could wish besides health
on my children two things, it would be unbelievable
self esteem which I do think I can control and then 
I wish it was unbelievable self awareness which 
I don&#39;t understand that I can control as much. - [Man 9] Hey Gary. - How are ya? - [Man 9] Great. I&#39;m going to take 
this opportunity to get some free life coaching, so thank you, in advance. I founded a successful company, and if I keep doing it 
for a few more years, I&#39;ll have hit my number, 
and I&#39;ll be done. - Right. - [Man 9] The problem is, 
I have this burning desire to 
be on the Snapchat, and like, giving advice, 
and helping young people, and all that? - Yeah. - [Man 9] But I don&#39;t have
the type of business where that
would like, feed into, leads, or anything like that, so it&#39;s a bit dilemma for me.
- Yes. - [Man 10] Do I start 
doing that now, or do I keep grinding, 
and try to like, hit this financial thing? And my girlfriend 
asked me last night, she&#39;s like, well, if you died, what would you be happier about, having that dollar 
in the bank account, or having your book published, and helped a 
lot of young people, and I was like, oh, fuck. (laughs) So, I just wanted
to throw it out and-- - Seems like you 
found the right girl. (laughter) I think, I think, I think my answer to that is, you should do both. I don&#39;t, like, 
what I would do if I were you, and what I normally do
in these situations, is I would audit the rest of it. So like, let&#39;s get real, are you willing to get 
very real with me? - [Man 9] Let&#39;s do it. - How many hours 
do you work a day? For real, don&#39;t bullshit me. - [Man 9] Six. - Do both. (laughter)
- [Man 9] Okay, thank you. (laughter and applause) - Because eight
is a fuckin&#39; half day, (laughter)
and that means you... And that means that 
you have two hours to do all that good, and
that&#39;s fuckin&#39; awesome, really. You know what&#39;s funny?
I want what you want, too. I, it&#39;s what I do, so
much, unfortunately for me, like, that&#39;s what cost me 16,
yeah, you know what I mean? So, you should, I mean,
if you, if you truly, if you wanna shoot it
black and white straight? You should do both, 
you should figure out how to get to eight, 
hopefully it doesn&#39;t take time out of, time together, hopefully it&#39;s coming out of, I don&#39;t know what 
the fuck you&#39;re doing with your other, fuckin&#39;...
(laughter) &quot;House of Cards&quot;, 
surfing, I don&#39;t know what the fuck 
you&#39;re doing, but like, like, two hours 
a day you can find to give advice, 
and do that stuff, and it&#39;s, it is, it is you know, it&#39;s so funny, like doing that, doing the whole 
personal brand thing, and being out there,
it&#39;s such a double win. Like, depending 
on how much vanity, and like, that stuff 
you have in, it gets to scratch that. I mean, I was waiting
for my car today in LA, some dude was 
flying down the highway, almost died, pulled over,
and was like, &quot;Gary V!&quot; And just left, like, that&#39;s
the biggest high, ever! (laughter)
Like, I was so pumped! And then, on the 
other hand, the fought, the other, and it&#39;s an
equal, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s better, or worse, for me, I mean, 
we&#39;re all wired different. The emails of people, 
like, hey man, you really helped me, like I was signing up for all this crap, I did this, 
this happened, you know. It&#39;s so, it&#39;s intoxicating 
for people to email you, and say that 
you changed their life. I have that happen to me
every day now, it&#39;s crazy! You know? It&#39;s crazy. So if you feel like, 
if you&#39;re feeling a yearning towards it, 
you should do it. - [Man 9] Awesome, thank you. - Yeah, man. - [Man 10] Gary, 
you talked about fires, and fighting fires, 
and I think that&#39;s a battle that probably all of
us do on a daily basis, right? So--
- Yes. - [Man 10] Well now, 
I have a two part question, one is, what do you 
fuck up on, often? - Yes. - [Man 10] And when you lose,
how do you not lose the lesson? - How do I not lose the lesson? So I love losing, and
I hate losing, right? They&#39;re like, polar opposites. So the thing I most 
fuck up on, is that I think I can do everything. I have big eyes, you
know? Fat kid cake. Right? Like, I just have big eyes. I just, because 
I work so much, and I work so hard, 
and so intense I always think that 
I can pull it off, so, sometimes I&#39;m just trying to
do 78 things, and you can&#39;t. That&#39;s my common mistake,
I&#39;ll always do that. Its, because 
somewhere deep down, I still think it&#39;s working out, &#39;cause I think 
it&#39;s a net-net game, but it is where I fall short, on more than a micro level,
probably a, three fourths micro,
all the way up to macro. For me, I never, 
I mean, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same 
reason that I remember everything that&#39;s ever happened, like I remember everything. Like, I remember Flowtown. Like, like, like you know?
Like, I remember everything. Like just, fuckin&#39; everything. And so, I, because of that, I guess? I don&#39;t lose the lessons? Because I can never, ever, understand why 
someone would knowingly make the same mistake twice. So. Yep. - [Man 7] You still 
good with time? Yeah, I&#39;m fighting it. 
I pushed the call for a second. - [Woman] Thank you for this. - You&#39;re welcome. - [Woman] I wanted 
to ask you a question, in fact, you were talking
about self-awareness. - Yes. - [Woman] And, where 
do you get most of your self-awareness 
is this one of the things you feel 
like you&#39;ve had-- - Yes
- Or is it life lessons, is it really the shit,
like, the hard moments? Can you give some 
examples of where you&#39;ve had some-- - I think it started--
- [Woman] Big awakenings? I guess, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, you know what? So, I realized somewhere 
around sophomore year of high school, that suddenly way more 
people than I wanted found me annoying. (laughter) That was probably the
first time I was like, maybe I was losing that like, I remember back, 
I remember early high school being like, wait a minute! They&#39;re not highly entertained and finding this interesting? (laughter) So, I do remember, I think it&#39;s DNA. 
I don&#39;t know where I get it, I don&#39;t, but I, 
when you said that, like, I do remember, 
from 12 to 18, I found my way, 
how to make this, more palpable, and 
I thought really owned it, and got great at it, until 
I became more of a public
figure, and every time 
I fuckin&#39; post a piece of content on 
Facebook it goes viral, 4,000 people 
say I&#39;m a dick face. (laughter) So, you know, 
I think that I try to deploy self-awareness 
as much as possible, and now, I&#39;m self-aware 
that 20% of people on first impact
(laughter) are not gonna like it. And so, I do think it came
from the lessons of life. Like, I think one of the
things that one has to do, is accept themselves, right? And I think once I&#39;m, 
once I did that, then it didn&#39;t hurt 
so much to have 20%, two out of 10 
people not like it. Because the cool thing 
with me is I also have three out of 10 people
that like it so much. And think it&#39;s the coolest
thing they&#39;ve ever seen, and you just play it out, 
and then for me, because I know I&#39;m grounded in very good truths, 
and principles? I get a second at-bat 
at it which is, it&#39;s so rewarding for 
people that thought you were a douchebag, to
turn, and become an advocate. I would tell you, probably the
50 biggest advocates I have on social? Initially hated me. - [Woman] Okay. So was
there, like, you know, a lot of people are in fear--
- Yes. - [Woman] Of being 
authentic, right? - Yes - [Woman] They don&#39;t even know necessarily, who they are, 
or even the unknown unknowns about
their own personality. - No, that&#39;s a really
good point, that&#39;s right. - [Woman] Okay. Okay. And so, but you, you have just always had that, what would you, what advice would you?
- I just tell people that they&#39;re gonna die. You&#39;re gonna die! - [Woman] Are you 
gonna die right this-- (laughter)
- You&#39;re gonna die, [Woman] - Okay.
- And at 91, when you&#39;re sitting
there, and you&#39;re like, &quot;You know what? Fuck!&quot; (laughter) I mean it! One of the, 
this is interesting to me, this is where, 
this is where hard wiring is something 
I believe in tremendously. It took me, again, when
this started all happening, my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s 
and 40 and then I&#39;ve started realizing this, 
boy did I fuckin&#39;, was I attracted to 
old people as a kid. Like, one of, I don&#39;t know
if any of you did this, and, then maybe we have
some connections that way. I was weird as shit, 
like, I, like, like, my friend would be, like,
I grew up in the 80&#39;s, when, which meant, you
played outside, right? And so, when we 
were outside playing, grandparents would 
visit once in a while, and maybe &#39;cause I didn&#39;t have, my, both my grandparents, 
three of my four grandparents died 
before I was born, people die young in Russia, &#39;cause they didn&#39;t 
wanna fuckin&#39; live. (laughter) And so, and so, maybe that&#39;s why? And I used to think 
that&#39;s why, but now I just realize, 
I mean, I learned a lot from just talkin&#39; to old people and I think I picked 
that up, at like, you know what I smelled? Regret. And I&#39;m gonna
tell you something. As scary as it is, 
for you to judge me? And for you to not think
I&#39;m cool, and this and that? What&#39;s way scarier, 
the thing I&#39;ve, I think one of the scariest
things in the world, is regret. You know why? 
You can&#39;t fix it. I can fix you thinking I&#39;m
a dick face over the time. I can&#39;t fix being 96
and becoming 64 again. And so, I think I&#39;m so
visceral to the regret that I smelled on 
old people as a kid, that it impacted me heavily. Yeah. [Tanya] Hi, I&#39;m Tanya. - Hey Tanya. - [Tanya] I work with 
teen entrepreneurs, have four of them here,
and I was just wondering if you could give 
them a piece of advice as kids that are in high school, - Yeah.
- [Tanya] 15, 16 years old, that are running 
successful companies, trying to balance, you
know, everything in life. - Yep. - [Tanya] Any piece of advice
that you may have for them? - Yes. Kids? 
Don&#39;t listen to Tanya. (Tanya laughs) Don&#39;t listen to your parents, definitely don&#39;t listen
to your fuckin&#39; teachers, (laughter)
don&#39;t listen to me, (laughter)
listen to yourself. And I fuckin&#39; mean that. (applause) You&#39;ll learn, if you&#39;re
wrong, you&#39;ll learn. And it&#39;s much better
to learn by tasting it, than reading about it,
or being told about it. That&#39;s my advice to &#39;em. - [Tanya] Thank you. - You got it. That&#39;s, and by the way, that&#39;s advice to 
entrepreneurs, right? Like, that&#39; what you, like,
that&#39;s not advice to operators, 
who are going to be CEO&#39;s of Fortune 500 companies. They&#39;ve gotta listen to parents, they&#39;ve gotta, like, they&#39;re
gonna play that game. But if you&#39;re 
an entrepreneur, there&#39;s, it&#39;s binary, you&#39;ve gotta
go completely the other way. &#39;Cause the market&#39;s the judge. And it&#39;s back to what
you and I talked about. When you&#39;re the 
entrepreneur, it&#39;s lonely. You know, 
Mom&#39;s not there to save you. - [Woman 2] Hey. - Hey. - [Woman 2] (laughs) I&#39;m a
New Yorker and a Jets fan, so, let&#39;s go Jets.
- I love you already. I also love your hair. - [Woman 2] Oh, thank you! - You&#39;re welcome. - [Woman 2] I think 
you kind of, sort of answered, sort of what 
I was gonna say, I&#39;m kinda new 
to not giving a fuck? - Okay. - [Woman 2] It&#39;s a 
new thing for me? - Yep. - [Woman 2] It&#39;s 
kind of happened-- - But has it always been there? (laughter)
- [Woman 2] Yeah! - It&#39;s always been there, right? - [Woman 2] Yes! I was
like, always nice to people. - But you&#39;re like, you know
what, I like this guy-- - [Woman 2] Yeah, 
I&#39;ve just kinda left-- - I&#39;m nice to people! - [Woman 2] No, no, no!
(laughter) I know, but I also, 
I feel less responsible for people&#39;s feelings. - Let me tell you 
something real quick, and some of you know this. I&#39;m only razzy on stage when I&#39;m not
talking to anybody individually. I&#39;m actually very 
uncomfortable with confrontation on 
a one-to-one level, and I would never, 
ever think about hurting somebody&#39;s feelings, for, like, why? - [Woman 2] Yeah. - You know, so-- - [Woman 2] I&#39;m with you. - You know? It&#39;s just when so-- I&#39;m more visceral 
when somebody else is doing something to someone. I&#39;m more of like, 
he&#39;s being mean to him, and I&#39;ll, that&#39;s when
I&#39;ll jump in, you know? - [Woman 2] Yes. And I
don&#39;t mean just being mean. - I get it.
- [Woman 2] Although, I have no problem 
with confrontation, whatsoever. (laughter)
I&#39;m a lawyer, so it kinda, and a New Yorker. - By the way, 
you know what, I apologize, my, I would actually argue,
my biggest weakness is, ever, was my lack, 
my visceral reaction to confrontation which
made me very bad at firing, for about 10 to 12 years,
because I was terrible at it. Like, I was terrible at it. I was so full of shit, like, I would never give 
any critical feedback, and then you just 
walk in and be fired, because I&#39;ve got pent up,
enough courage to finally do it, I was terrible at it. And it, and I was 
really bad at it. And it&#39;s something I&#39;m
very embarrassed about. And the worst 
version of it, is it&#39;s how I broke up 
with girls, and I hate to say it out loud,
(laughter) because I wanna be 
really, like it was, it&#39;s the single thing
I&#39;m most embarrassed of, of the way I broke up
with girls that I dated, because I wasn&#39;t a man enough
to break up to their face. That felt good. (laughter) Good to get the, good
to get the poison out. (laughter and applause) All right, go ahead. - [Woman 2] We forgive you. - Thank you. (laughs) - [Woman 2] So, 
my question really is, like, what&#39;s the ROI 
on not giving a fuck and being 
apologetically yourself. &#39;Cause that&#39;s--
- Speed. Speed. The thing that you, 
when you&#39;re not spending any time worrying, you&#39;re spending 
time on executing. Speed. And I like the way a lot
of you reacted to that, because that&#39;s a weird
answer to that question. But I can see that 
a lot of you caught it, and some of you 
understand it and do it. Speed is the game in what
we all do for a living. And if you&#39;re not worried about dwelling on what people think,
you&#39;re in execution mode. And I do everything 
in my possession, everything in my power, 
excuse me, to put myself in full
execution mode at all times. - [Woman 2] Awesome. Thank you. - You got it. All right, now 
I have to go. I love you guys! (cheering and applause) I had a lotta fun, a
lot of fun. Thank you.
