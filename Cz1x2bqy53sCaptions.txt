A modern times tragedy I wish to dedicate this movie
to the France of tomorrow but since she&#39;s embodied in you,
i may, very humbly, dedicate it to you,
Mr Le Marechal. It is when there is no more hope that there&#39;s nothing to be hopless for. I saw this on a stained glass,
on the stained glass of my church O the sun, the sea, the breeze
the sailors on the shore it&#39;s the harvest of all the dreams   a man, a woman and love,
 and it ends like it starts. Goutard, eyes illness. Sit down. What&#39;s your job? Snapshot editor and during 
the slack season, i&#39;m a model. I guess you came here
for an assurance certificate  like your little friends. No, i just wanted to know why
the street gaslamps flicker this way when i look at them at night. Since...?- Since 6 to 8 months. You should have come earlier,
I could have operated on you. - Operate?
- Too bad. What&#39;s your name? Clarisse, but it is Venus for the artists. Venus?! - They say it was an antic godess
 who...- I know. Why did you say &quot; too bad&quot;? - Is it you? - It&#39;s me. My name
has become a cigarette brand. Every man buys me. I&#39;m really in demand! It smells french fries in here. What a funny face! 
You&#39;re scaring me. - Do you have relatives?
- Only a sister. Mireille.She&#39;s waiting for me downstairs. - Call her up.- I can&#39;t.
It&#39;s too high. She&#39;s a cripple. Why? Are you afraid to tell me? I must know. In my job, eyes need to be perfect. You have an inferior unsticking of the retina. I don&#39; t understand. It would not help anyway. Now, you have to be very sober. No cigarettes.No alcohol. No... The convent without the
musketeers! Try these medicines anyway. So you think that..... Don&#39;t desperate now. It may last for one year, two years.... You have your degrees, so you
don&#39;t tell stories... Is it with this you could see? - Is it  really the truth?
- You see i was wrong to tell you. No stories!
I&#39; m only asking you  if it&#39;s really the truth!
- I swear. - Goodbye doctor.
- Goodbuy Clarisse. Please wait for i can&#39;t
see you in detail no more! So what did the doctor tell you? Quick, let&#39;s go to the
other oculist, Barbes. Right now?-Yes! -What&#39;s wrong?-Nothing, come
i&#39;ll tell you.      At the red cork. Do you know Clarisse&#39;s adress? Shout you stupid. It doesn&#39;t hurt. Shout the like. See you got the link: first the legs, the arms, the neck, the head, the chest
and the back. Lets start again. - Is this one your father or
 your husband?- My husband. When we sing the time of the cherries,  will be singing much better .... much better ... You&#39;re hurting me. much better ! F sharp!  better..the mocking bird. Hey, boy. What&#39;s up my beauty? - This Mr&#39;s looking for Venus adress.
- Another one! He met her in Paris.He&#39;s the
painter, the big poster painter. Mr Gazul. You really hit the bull&#39;s eye
with your poster! Clarisse became Venus  thanks
 to it for the customers. - The customers?-No, not those ones! A real hottie, this girl! but
she burns up if you touch her! - She came here only for singing.
- Only? It&#39;s mad how much the customers liked her! Mad. Bugger off, little snot! Don&#39;t think i was taking
personal advantage on her. I never meant to. Neither did she, you hear? But she&#39;s such an astounding
pretty girl! - Yes indeed, unfortunatly!
- Tartuff! Give us the same. - What does she do now?
- She&#39;s in the photo. My customers are launching
a soap brand and they want the same face for a new poster. - Only the face?
- Yes, because of her look. It won&#39;t be easy because
Madere closely looks after her. He&#39;s a master mariner who
loves her and waits for the &quot;noisy one &quot; insurance
to marry her. What&#39;s that?- It&#39;s his boat. It&#39;s damaged and been anchored
for two years. Trials.Expert&#39;s reports... Meanwhile, he starves. One more reason to
make a deal with them. Where can i find her? At Madere&#39;s. On The &quot;noisy
 one&quot;, at the boats cemetary.. Be careful, Madere isn&#39;t a
common sailor. He won&#39;t like you wandering
around Clarisse and wanting her face displayed  again on
every wall of France. - And in every bathroom!
- I&#39;ve seen more.. Not like him! He&#39;s quite an odd man.He only likes
his boat, aside Clarisse. With all the pianos you have sold to Mr, don&#39;t you hear this
one is blaring wrong? Of course i do .Come on,
Olympia, flatter!   You&#39;re wrong. Venus
is not your kind of woman. Very well. You like this jackanapes! - Absolutely.- Marjorie! What&#39;s wrong, Roquefort? A pin! It stung me! Where at? And it wants to be a
world champion! They all are stung
by their Venus. - Here baby, a Venus cocktail!
- Thanks grandma.    What are you doing here? I&#39;m scared. I hear voices. It&#39;s me. I&#39; m training for my ventriloquist show
at the red corck.   Air ! You&#39;re letting me choke! Air ! Turn it off. It cuts off the oxygen. I can&#39;t do it Madere or Ill have to stop the
scuba pump!  Screwed-up! 28 is an old age for a boat.  Poor old one..... You&#39;re right to be sorry for me. I&#39; m sorry for the boat, stupid. Don&#39;t worry this way. You have no heart. You&#39;re a
fool failed dog! Don&#39;t you see that a boat suffers, dies like a man!
And talks too! What is the &quot;noisy one &quot;
telling today? Nothing.She&#39;s crying. - You hear? - Don&#39;t worry. Stop unscrewing my head! What were you doing idiot? I was polishing my new show. You&#39;ve been polishing
it for 10 years! Soon, i&#39;ll be at the red cork. Don&#39;t mention it anymore or
i&#39;ll throw you to the sharks! - What&#39;s wrong?-Nothing. Only it&#39;s the fifth and bad things
always happen to me then. You&#39;re crazy about her, aren&#39;t you? That&#39;s not saying enough, Ulysse. If i look so sad since a few days,
it&#39;s because i&#39;m too happy with her. Funny. Being too happy. But i&#39;m afraid we may quit. I could never overcome it. She&#39;s really cheering up the view! Fortunately! Who&#39;s that looney one
coming to our place?  I&#39;m waiting for a woman. What woman? That&#39;s my business! I don&#39;t care who you&#39;re
looking for but do it elsewhere! - You&#39;re in a preserve.
-So i&#39;m a poacher! What do you stop
at the red cork for? You know Madere has
forbidden you to come here. She must have split
up with Madere. What a chance! If only she could sing here,
we could pay the cottage cash! Only her used to make
money here! Venus has guts but if Madere finds her here,
he will crush her! Why don&#39;t you speak to me?
Is it that serious? Are you sure? Come on, you must
clear off here! Who are you? See the signature: Gazul. That&#39;s me!- So what? So i have a proposal for Clarisse. I&#39;ve been asked for her
for her soap brand. You sure would like her
to pose in a bathtube. This would be a change
from the &quot;noisy one &quot;. Cross her off your plans
or i drop you! What will Madere say? You&#39;ve heard what Barbes said.
He has confirmed. One year. Perhaps. To think that what he liked
the most were my eyes! What will Madere say? It was too beautiful!
We loved each other too much! Only in tales, it ends well. One night, you go home,and, because of a curse of fate, the biggest love on earth suddenly breaks apart like a castle of cards, with no words left to the hearts... I never could tell him
such a thing I know him.He looks like a brute,
but he&#39;s the best of all. He would not let his sorrow show to ease mine. He would count down my light days, and when it&#39;s over and i can&#39;t see anymore, he would want us to kill
ourselves together. My darling! Even if i&#39;m wrong, i don&#39;t want
 Madere to become a guide dog. Can you see him guiding me
by hands for years, like a slave? Feeding me! No never! How you must love him
to say all this! Two sisters, two cripples! The blind one and the paralytic one. The drunkenness of our father...
What a heavy bill to pay! I pay with my legs, 
you with your eyes. - Promise me you won&#39;t...
- Kill myself. Put me at rest! No, i won&#39;t if i can quit Madere. Why quitting him right now? Because later i would 
not be strong enough. You must break off. He only lives by you, for you. What good reason will you give him? That&#39;s my business. Swear me that, whatever happens, you will never tell Madere why! I swear it! - On my eyes?
- On your eyes! This will be the only memory. Smoke.... Indigo! I&#39;ll have a room again. And your singing show too? No,i have a job; i want to work. Alone. You understand? So please book me the room 5 for tomorrow. Please come Clarisse. What time is it? You toldd me she had to bring some
edition work back from town. She&#39;ll be back. You don&#39;t know how jealous 
i am of all she does! Even of the sweet portraits she fixes! Jealous of postcards!? Because she has to look at
them too long. And it ruins her eyes.. Gisele! Back under? Where is Madere? Out - Too bad.I&#39;ve brought him
some rose seeds i sponsor. - Seeds?- Gisele Rose. Take it in your hanging garden,
my little Ulysse. My face is on the packs too. Moron! Idiot!I&#39;m suffocating! What are you doing down there? A new year&#39;s visit. Don&#39;t you want me
to come with you? I&#39;m afraid of fishtailed women. It would not be of any use. Right.Even at the seabed, I&#39;m in love with Clarisse. Don&#39;t waste your breath. Don&#39;t waste your time,my beauty. Why not come up to see if i&#39;m
still your beauty? In 2 years, one changes his mind. You didn&#39;t mind asking anybody 
to take me in your arms me then. Remember Madere, you were a real sailor then, a
real traveler, like me. Now i have all i need in port. You sound like it.You&#39;re making
yourself into a husband. That&#39;s it. When i have received my boat&#39;s insurance, i will 
marry Clarisse. I can&#39;t believe it, my little Madere. You&#39;re hard of hearing, my little Gisele. At least, tell me what&#39;s the
plan behind it. I&#39;m putting in a mine..  I wouldn&#39;t dare come home,
if i were you. Your eyes are hurting, darling. Don&#39;t worry, here they are! He&#39;s been really worrying. You&#39;re going to stifle her! My love, how pale you are! Come diner quick. Mireille, don&#39;t you say
goodbye to your little Ulysse? Goddnight. What a hurry! Theres&#39; going to be a heavy shower. I&#39;ve been making up so many things. Now that you&#39;re here, it&#39;s gone. You&#39;re shaking! Are you cold?
You must be hungry. Is the dinner ready Mireille? You both look like you have cried. You see the barometer, such a
depression is quite rare. Listen to the &quot;noisy one &quot;: She sounds like she wants to leave. Drop the anchors, Ulysse! Everything in life wants to leave. That&#39;s why we must moor one another, as long as we like each other and
we&#39;re still young. So is hapiness: it&#39;s so short, already over at the time we&#39;re
speaking about it. It&#39;s golden like the fishermen
oars at the sunset. Why are you looking at me this way, as if  you have never seen me before? You&#39;re blurring me. What beautiful eyes!   To think i fell in love with
 you because of your eyes! Shut up! Come to diner. - Ain&#39;t hungry. You&#39;ll leave us alone after diner. We&#39;ll rehearse Ulysse show
in my cabin after diner. - Very good idea.  So, when do you start 
at the horrible pub? When it&#39;s ok of course.  I&#39;ll need your advice
on the makeup Clarisse. I&#39;m still undecided on Grock
or on Chaplin, or better. All right, save your
muddle for the &quot;red cork&quot;. What&#39;s wrong with you? You didn&#39;t eat nor speak at all. Are you afraid of the thunderstorm? This mournful buoy which pierces our ears, shan&#39;t it ever stop? Touch my heart. You see i&#39;m always deeply moved when i stand
next to you. I feel like crying and laughing. To prove my love to you, i&#39;m ready to do the most
difficult thing in the world . Listen: if you&#39;re still so jealous of my boat, i&#39;m ready to leave it
to live in town with you. Why are you crying? Come and see Ulysse.
You&#39;re fond of his tricks. You&#39;re his only audience. Come. That&#39;s not it? Yes, it is very good. Come, let&#39;s leave them alone. Nothing in this hat! What is this? This idiot imitates me. Answer me, is it her? You showed her in here? I&#39;d be very surprise if she comes back. Between the cigarettes
and the redheaded, you have the choice.
- What do you mean? - That you&#39;re free. - Free? Did i ask you where
you spent your afternoon? I can tell you, if you&#39;re interested : 
at the red cork. - Repeat!- At the red cork. You&#39;re putting me on? No, it&#39;s about soap. I get it. Give me that wet hat! - What about the rabbit?
- Give it! Return it too your
friend, the painter. My friend painter? Don&#39;t be a fool. You know
well whose hat it is! Yes, so what? So you want to start your
old job again? You&#39;re one prophet tonight. It&#39;s unbelievable all that i&#39;m guessing. You guess it all but
get nothing out of it. Get that i got cheated about
this painter? Men always find some ridiculous 
word when they get angry. Is it the &quot;cheat&quot; word which
makes me so ridiculous? Good guess! You&#39;re only testing me, aren&#39;t you? Look at me. You&#39;ve always sweared to me that there was nothing
between you and Gazul. You have little memory. So i imagine it&#39;s the same
with the others too? Imagine ! Has she gone crazy? Let him alone or he&#39;ll get
even more mad. You have enough
of your life with me! Why force me to tell you? Go back with this grotesque 
dummy i threw into the water! Now it&#39;s my turn? I&#39;d fear to dirty the
port&#39;s water even more! It must not be your first
affair since you&#39;ve met him! - Come on speak.
- Questionning me is relieving you. You want the names of
my affairs. The names, the ratings, i have a notebook under my pillow.. No, I remember that Mireille
 threw it into the water. This goody-goody knows
all about it too! You were her partner too!  Don&#39;t go in! Are you gonna lock 
me in here? Yes. Until i&#39; m up to
meet Gisele again. Why not? Her face isn&#39;t lying around every smockers&#39; pockets like yours! She&#39;s simply the godmother
of the roses you &#39;re smelling. I don&#39;t think she has become the lover of the painter who sketched her portrait on all the seeds packets.  Bitch! Leave them alone.She really deserves it! I want to kill you! Enough!  He&#39;s waiting for you at the red cork. - Yes tomorrow! - Don&#39;t 
you realise your crime? Throw me out! Can&#39;t you see i can&#39;t stand it anymore!? My little darling, does it hurt? I swear she did nothing wrong! Don&#39;t listen to her. She likes her small life  here. She&#39;s lying; she knows all about it. PLease Madère, listen to me. ? Mireille!Throw her out too. Yes, leave too! Where are you going? She&#39;s seen  enough of us, me, the &quot;noisy one &quot;, and your dirty face. She needs something new and she&#39;s gonna get it. Everybody splits. I want to
be alone! My darling. I could not stand more. I wanted so much to fling myself around his neck, to
kiss him, to shout at him : &quot; All this ain&#39;t true, my love!&quot;. This woman will never
know what i &#39;ve done for her. How could you? Your courage scares me. To think i almost made him slowly forget about his 
boat to be his wife. Shut up! My love. I &#39;m exhausted! - Are you still sure?
- More than ever. I wrapped all the edition equipment. Now that it&#39;s ready,   leave and i&#39;ll take 
it up on the deck. Hurry up. He must not see you here again. If he does, you&#39;re in mortal
danger.  I stay on the boat
I&#39;lll watch him.    Leave. Yes she&#39;s here, but it&#39;s not a reason why to  show her your roses faces! Leave.She wants peace! It&#39;s been really too quiet
since you left! You&#39;re one woman of a kind, Venus,
for the customers. Call me Clarisse. It&#39;s a nun&#39;s name. You said it right. I&#39;ll leave like an ermit here. I&#39;ve a little spare edition job to do. I must spare a little money
for a long trip. - A trip?-  Yes , a long night trip. - A night trip? - Please indigo, stop asking me questions and
tell noone that i&#39;m here. - You&#39;re not the same Venus.
- Clarisse please. That has to be Madere! Be careful!  Don&#39;t worry for him. He won&#39;t step in here anymore. I didn&#39;t do anything cause... You see how i can take it! Take that, that&#39;ll teach you
to protect the virtue flowers! I came to take care of the roses and to help you too
because i know ... Are you gonna throw me out again? - No, i&#39;m gonna leave.- Where? To the edge of the world.
On a long haul ship, any ship... Take me with you! I&#39;m threw with women. I&#39;m fed up 
with love , affection. You&#39;re just as a liar as the others. You get on my nerves too. Music is over. I want freedom, 
loneliness....peace! Get my stuff ready, i split. - You won&#39;t let the &quot;noisy one &quot; 
down? - I split! If you win your suit and get 
the insurance we can fix it . - You&#39;re nice but i&#39;m fed up, i split!
- Come on. He may not like it but it was
high time i came. A few hours more,and we&#39;d miss
our hapiness together. - So you think that him and you...
- I&#39;m sure of it. I change the record. Take her for singing.
 Only this could save her. She strains her eyes 
with these stupid photos. You know i&#39;d love too, that
my customers are crazy for her, and that my cafe is a new
club when she performs. I&#39;ll do all i can to help you. Nice girl. Venus.... Clarisse... I&#39;ve settled many maritime
insurance cases but it&#39;s the first time i submit a fortune to a
neurasthenic of your kind! You misscall me a love girl,
a hell girl, earthmen, i won&#39;t answer, i love the sea. All the skies lay in my chest,
and all the birds in my voice, to the fascinated ones, 
my eyes are like rafts. Desires prowl around me, 
but the furious ocean closes its emerald field 
over the farewell water. Marked by the salty water of his mouth,   I love the sea. This is talent. This is a temperament. - Are all nights like this one?
- For a month. - You must be happy.
- Rather overcame with joy! Marceline, tell her i offer her
some bubbly. She&#39;s not free.. Bubbly!? Tonight, she&#39;s
drinking Champagne with Shangai. Only the big ones are privileged,
here like anywhere else. You&#39;ve been warned: she won&#39;t
drink with Shangai nor the voyeur. What&#39;s happening? Give me a hand,  guys. What a bad luck, we&#39;ve been
making 3000 a night! Move along. Who&#39;s gonna stand in 
for Venus off the cuff? Sensational comebak of Venus
with her new repertoire. Place your bets, no more bets. In a very, very small village
near Bastia, there was a sweet good girl,
the bella rosetta. When she appeared
at the churchplace on sunday, arching her hips ,
dark hair and white dress, every men said: Bella rosetta you&#39;re
giving us the risetta, But Rosette, though
she was coquette, would not answer back. Cause the pretty Rosette
had only one crazy dream: to be the Bastia young virtuous girl. No one must come in.
She needs some air now. - Can she sing tomorrow?
- Of course. Do the announcement.
He&#39;s dead deaf. The dream is ending.... Before my conjuring show, i must tell you on behalf of
 the direction, that my comrade Venus can&#39;t do
the second part of her show. Don&#39;t worry. The sudden turn
she has suffered announces ... ...the coming... Go ahead talker! Talkers may be conjurors,
but conjurors ain&#39;t talkers. Out with it ! - That&#39;s it ! The birth..
- In happiness...! I  never thought one
could be so happy. How dumb we are. Either we feel joy or pain, it&#39;s the same,
we&#39;re still crying. What are you going
to do now? You&#39;re asking me!?
Telling it to Madere. He hoped for it so much,
that he must know. That would be the last straw
if he doubts it! I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll
believe you. How mad it was to leave him! No i was right because i was alone but now i
owe him the truth. With the child between
you two, you&#39;ll see... Let&#39;s imagine the worst: even  blind; with him you&#39;ll
 be so happy. A blind woman would not be a mother. A father would be needed to take my place. Then we could marry. Marry ! I&#39; m feeling alive 
when i say this word. When the baby is here and you
 can watch him....I mean.... What came in your mind? Forgive me, i didn&#39;t have the same terrible thought you&#39;ve just had.  Don&#39;t cry. I&#39;m sure You&#39;ll see your litle boy. It&#39;d be too unfair ..and your sight is getting better. We&#39;ll call Venus&#39; son Cupidon! If it&#39;s a girl, it&#39;ll be Violette! It must be Ulysse. He spoils
everything, even success. My act may be a little too
subtle for your stage. - Did you have stage fright? 
- No,only at the first tomato. Poor Ulysse, Audience doesn&#39;t 
understand magic anymore. - Thanks. - I feel grateful to
all who make me feel life isn&#39;t the way i see it.
Even with tricks. What happened? Trumpets are over.
It&#39;s a shame. I lost the pigeon. Stupid! Here&#39;s to Violette! Nasty animal! No matter, we&#39;ll eat it
with peas. What&#39;s wrong with these lyrics writers  who don&#39;t think  life is marvellous Who are you waiting for this morning? I won&#39;t tell you
cause i&#39;m superstious. I hope for the greatest
joy of my life. You&#39;re glowing with hapiness. - That&#39;s nothing compared
to what&#39;s next.- Next? - Now! Here she comes??
-  Who? -  Mireille. - So? - He left on the &quot;oasis&quot; yesterday for a one year long
trip on the pacific ocean. - Was he alone? - Yes of course. It&#39;s funny that this woman hasn&#39;t come out of her
lux cabin once. Not even at the port of call. Officers don&#39;t know
who she is. The steward tipped me off that
she goes to Melbourne. - May be she&#39;s a spy?
- They say she&#39;s gorgeous. I want a report on the
hold men&#39;card games. The oasis is not a club!
The stockroom is not a cafeteria! - You have changed Madere.
- Gisele! Won&#39;t you come in? Are you afraid
of me? - No. I only pity you. Being so foolish with you,
i don&#39;t mind being insulted. You&#39;ll be filled with it,
and thanks for the sea companies. - Excuse me? - It was very kind of you to pay for a lux cabin
only for my beautiful eyes. - But it&#39;s a flop? - Which means? That i&#39; m begging you not
to talk to me anymore. Boor! Tell the captain i&#39;m getting
off at the next stop. I want to go back to France. There&#39;s
no more sense to my journey. The doctor told you
not to weary your eyes. You want to know about the stops? You cant read. It&#39;s written too small. Colombo,
Singapour. It&#39;s as if i could see
the water between us. It seems far away but time goes fast. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s thinking of you. If only it was true. Let&#39;s hope i can see my baby
when he&#39;s born. Whatever you want... You have a cigarette? I saw the woman of the fifth today. Very lovely. She&#39;s leaving us at the next stop. Keep the packet lieutenant. It&#39;s time to rest. You &#39;re getting  weary by watching at Violette for hours and there&#39;s too
much light in here. Let me watch a little more,
It feels so good watching her. How much she looks like him! How happy he&#39;ll be too! May i hold Violette? I&#39;ll give her you back
as soon as the &#39;oasis&#39; is here. She won&#39;t even hand me her. Lay on me, you&#39;re so pale. She has not slept for three nights. I got it all set up in my mind: the five of us will live on the &quot;noisy one &quot; .. - No, no..- Here comes the oasis! I can see him! Here he comes! It&#39;s still everywhere. The whole port was already 
after her before we left. Don&#39;t talk about her anymore. - You know i crossed her off.
- A bit of spleen? Yeah, the home&#39;s air, you know,
it moves Then let&#39;s not pass by the &quot;noisy one &quot;. No way, i want to know if she&#39;s
still at the same place. You swore not to talk to me
about her anymore...and i&#39;m so anxious to visit this &quot;the 
Arabian Nights&quot; palace you rented. Here everything is in glass-paper,
candy like , ridiculous. No it&#39;s not. Of course, it&#39;s far from the &quot;noisy one &quot; and
the pubs of the port. - You really needed a leash.
- A leash? Clarisse? I&#39;m gonna see her, alone. I forbid you to see
this singer at the bawling pub. You&#39;re through with her. You
promised me. This way, madam.  Have a seat. - Cigarette? - I stopped 
smoking this brand.Thanks. I&#39;m not here to soften you.
Life is life. But you understand what i mean,
as delicate as it may be. May i go ahead of your
explanations? Why not. It&#39;s you who let me know
you wished to get rid off the &quot;noisy one &quot; and its owner.
- Yes, i did. I didn&#39;t interfere in your 
relationships before you let me do. Today i &#39;m asking you to
do the same with us. It&#39;s far out. You only gave in to your desire. I&#39;m sure you did. Today it&#39;s my turn. I don&#39;t get it. I have to marry Madere. There are a lot of 
ways to persuade you. What do you mean, &quot;no&quot;? Don&#39;t force me to...- Too late, madame. - Married.- 10 months ago,
 in the French indies, at Karikal. Then you&#39;ll divorce. - Madere  won&#39;t... Yes he will, cause i wrote to him. He torn your letters up
without reading it. Then you don&#39;t know that... What &#39;s this new pressure
you &#39;re trying to put on me? - Your child !
- Our child. So now i understand. You didn&#39;t know. - Are you happy? - Very happy. Forgive me for hurting you, but promise me not to see him again. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to
destroy such a happiness, which took so many years
 of patience to build up. Each one our turn. Don&#39;t start a new drama. That&#39;s my daughter&#39;s life and mine that you hold in your hands. Your litttle daughter... - Can i rely on you?
- You have nothing to fear from me. What happened? People won&#39;t believe you when
misery goes beyond their habits. Didn&#39;t you explain them everything? No because... Madere is a new man. He was here. I&#39;m sure of it. He didn&#39;t even show himself. He forgot us all, even the &quot;noisy one &quot;. I told you. Stop thinking about it! Let&#39;s make him feel we&#39;re his martyrs. Com&#39;on, have some guts! And Ulysse will explain to them. What did the doctor say? Not much...words. Are you back at the red cork tomorrow? How else? We&#39;re broke! I&#39;m no good to you.I&#39;m a burden to you with my bad legs. Shut up. I would not have stayed
alive without you. Hi girls! A present for Violette. How wonderful ! For our future star Violette.
Your friends from the red cork. How nice! Mireille, see how much she looks
like Violette! Indeed! What a coincidence ! - What are you doing?
- I&#39;m looking at her. It&#39;s hard to believe how much
i missed her. That&#39;s what i thought : you&#39;re back with us. No way. I&#39;m married. - Are you happy? - I&#39;m fine. Pleasure and happiness ain&#39;t the same. I have my child too. Clarisse has her own child too. What do you mean? I don&#39;t mean it. I&#39;m telling you.
i&#39;m shouting it to you. You&#39;re the father! Haven&#39;t you ever asked yourself
why she is called Venus? So what. There&#39;s a star too with this name. But I haven&#39;t got my 
head in the clouds. Didn&#39;t she cheat on me a
thousand times? She told me herself. Her sister Mireille was in it.
So leave me alone! Listen, Madere... Disn&#39;t she sing at the red cork
before and after i had left? I have something more to
tell you. She&#39;s awfully unhappy because... Again: wasn&#39;t she at the 
red cork after i left? - Of course but....
- So It&#39;s clear. Let&#39;s find out together : Why not Gazul? You&#39;re hurting me. You&#39;re right Ulysse:
I&#39;m a poor fool. If Venus had a child, let&#39;s not find the father;
he has too many. - Couldn&#39;t she say so about yours?
- Beat it or... Wait... you said very unhappy? You should have said it first.
I know life and i have a heart. For her. Keep your money. Clarisse was right. There&#39;s an epidemy of diphteria. The doctor advises you to send the little one to the mountains. Do as he said. Stunning come-back of Venus 
with her new repertoire In a very, very small village near Bastia, there was a sweet good girl, the bella rosetta. When she appeared At the churchplace on sunday, arching her hips , dark hair and white dress, every men said: Bella rosetta you&#39;re
giving us the risetta, But Rosette, though
she was coquette, would not answer back. Cause the pretty Rosette had only one crazy dream: to be the Bastia young virtuous girl. You know i&#39;ve been a carpenter since 1926 and wood 
is getting unaffordable. Is it still far? No, you can see the
unloading dock of the zone - Have a light?-  Yes. It&#39;s a rude stroll . It gets you very hungry. - Terrible! - Poor woman. What are you thinking about? That there was no man near 
 Clarisse in the cortege. - So? - Nothing. It&#39;s just a fact. I have something to tell you. Let&#39;s go outside then. Don&#39;t worry for scandal. It&#39;s about Clarisse, not me. Sorry for the odd question, but
i need an answer: what kind of life has Clarisse had since she went back to the red cork? A perfect life.Beyond reproach. - Really? - I swear on this one. She wants to be left alone. I&#39;m afraid. It&#39;s only her reaction.She&#39;s got nothing to fear. We&#39;re here. Watch this! What is she doing? She&#39;s puting Violette&#39;s clothes
on the doll. What&#39;s going on in her poor head? I understand. Dead children are
much more alive than the others. - It&#39;s still a presence for her.
- A presence? Is the Madonna you prey something more than a wooden or plaster statue? Is the picture of a gone beloved that you kiss something more than a piece of card? There&#39;s no explanation to it. You feel it. Men can&#39;t understand . - Clarisse. -  Call me Venus. From now on, Clarisse is dead. We&#39;re all gonna go away from here. Go away. What for? What about the red cork? Not after this mourning? There&#39;s no mourning for the unhappy ones. I wanna work to eat. I&#39;ll sing tomorrow. - You can&#39;t! - Tell Indigo to announce the show. What are you waiting for? Are you deaf? Leave her alone, Ulysse. Come. - You&#39;re going out?
- Yes You&#39;re still in love with this poor woman. What are you talking about? - Do you want to see the baby?- No. - You! - PLease -  Go away. Let me talk to you. There&#39;s something inexplicable and  terryfying in what has happened to us. - Tell me clarisse.- Too late! - Go away. - I beg you. One word only. I&#39;ve come humble, submissive,ready to fix. Too late. She&#39;s dead. There&#39;s nothing left
to fix. Was she our child? No, fool, a thousand times no! You&#39;re shaking. Your eyes
disagree with your words. So what now? Why didn&#39;t you tell me?
I don&#39;t understand! Don&#39;t be so curious, you&#39;d
do two more victims. Go away, you still have something
to fight for ! Can&#39;t you see i&#39;ve never
stopped loving you, suffering for you. Too bad.She took your name,
your image and all the love i still had for you in the grave. Today it&#39;s all over. Nothing
will make me change. I don&#39;t want to see you anymore,
to hear from you or the sound of your voice. To me, you died with her. Go Madere, The &quot;noisy one &quot;doesn&#39;t
like the men who cry. She doesn&#39;t want you either. You&#39;re not home anymore.
Go. Don&#39;t you touch me! You see i don&#39;t even cry. Go! Men i hate you.... What guts she has! The day after such a terrible day. She&#39;s one of a kind.She refused to be stood in for. I&#39;m still flabbergasted. ? ? ? We&#39;re here to drink together. Pleasure has had us gathered. I don&#39;t want your mercy. Men i hate you. What are we for you in the end? A poor thing called a beast of pleasure. You never show a single move, a single nice attention. You all only despise us to better demean us. And when i sing i think of you whom i don&#39;t care for; but your offenses and insults break against our pride. Men i hate you. For ever and ever we &#39;ve always been  to you the eternal beast of burden, forever. Good night. Great lyrics. How true! Do not trust men, the filthy men! Who wrote this masterpiece? I did, dove. My darling... - Where are you going?
- Am i asking you? Feel the edge of the sidewalk
with your sticks. Don&#39;t be afraid to move forward. Keep your dog on the right. Listen to my voice.... I talked to the director about you.
You should do movies. Don&#39;t be stupid, Lucien.
You know i&#39;m married. Married..... Mireille! It&#39;s you? What&#39;s wrong darling? Answer me : you were asleep and
i woke you up? It&#39;s night, isn&#39;t it? What&#39;s wrong? Yes Clarisse, it is. Come closer. I see you like in a whirl. Turn on the light,  one can&#39;t see. Yes. At least  a bit of night to take a breath. I won&#39;t see anymore all these ugliness of life, all these hard and hostile things to me, all these men faces staring at me 
with their ugliest thoughts, I&#39;ll live with my memories, with your image, Mireille, and Violet&#39;s one. My two darlings. I&#39;m gonna settle down in
my darkness like a convalescent. I&#39;ll be able to live backwards. I have so many things of
mine to look at. Mireille, answer me me. Where are you? Clarisse - What are you doing? - You see, i&#39;m
playing blind man&#39;s bluff. Sorry i had to leave. I couldn&#39;t stand this nightmare atmosphere anymore. This doll at the table everyday! It wrecks my heart. Watch! What the pain can make up! Unbelievable. She acts as if it was Violet. She can&#39;t do without it. It&#39;s her only consolation, her lifesaver. Watch, she&#39;s rocking it! When they suffer too much, men are like children. We should try to take her mind off, else... Nothing on this boat could cure her. Here misery and sadness stick into your skin. She needs to be taken elsewhere...Unless.... Yes?! What if Madere comes back? She would kill him! Only her hate for him
lie her to the world. Come Ulysse,let&#39;s get back in. Here come Juliette and Romeo. I must go home, the storm is coming. Listen ! Something is going to happen. The ship is singing the same song as the year we left. Please go to bed. You remember, Mireille, this terrible minute when Madere said about Gisele &quot;Her face isn&#39;t lying around every smockers&#39; pockets like yours!&quot;, when he yelled at me &quot; Bitch! i want to kill you!&quot; I  can still see his face! Someone has come in. The wind just took it away. Oh the wind... I&#39;m right on the deck to lock the hinged sections. What&#39;s going on? Didn&#39;t you know that she was blind?- Blind!?- Yes. You behaved  like a scoundrel with us but you must know the truth. Here lay down quietly. Don&#39;t be nervous. Rather listen to the rehearsal of my musical show. Now you know. She lied to you so that you don&#39;t suffer. She&#39;s blind, our child is dead, and i knew nothing! Guessed nothing, understood nothing. My sister is a saint Madere. She loved you like nobody has ever loved a man. Why?! Why is life always like a bitch by destroying the best she
makes ? Your poor eyes. It&#39;s so unfair. I put a world between us because of my stupid pride. Now that i&#39;m back, it&#39;s too late. I&#39;m a criminal. Yes, it&#39;s too late. Now she hates you. You&#39;d wake her pain up. She&#39;s fed up.  At least, let her died quietly. Go away ! Forgiveness....Redemtion... Too late.The harm is done. I only have to go dying elsewhere. I&#39;m not worthy of ending near her, here on my boat. What do you think,
my old &quot;noisy one &quot; ? You don&#39;t even know me anymore. Listen Mireille. The ship is talking! &quot;Don&#39;t go, don&#39;t go&quot; Don&#39;t go Madere.
There&#39;s work for you here. Clarisse is asleep. Come i have to talk to you. What are you doing? I&#39;ve just put myself
in my new character&#39;s shoes. -Pierrot? -Only pierrot can find the path to happiness. -I&#39;ve found yours.- Ours? You&#39;re mad as usual. Yes. Mad with joy. While playing ocarina sooner, i had Ulysse&#39;s brightest idea, the 
one which will make him famous. Laughing at us in such a time! No, my idea is going to turn everything upside down here. If only the new casino&#39;s director knew about it... But it&#39;s not acting! You&#39;re right. But what i&#39;ve missed in acting,
i&#39;m gonna make it in real life. After such a storm in our life, what can you still hope for? The rainbow ! Don&#39;t you want her to let you stay? Don&#39;t you want your wife back
and make her happy again? How could you have her see again? How could you restore this misery, give back life to this boat? It&#39;s an easy one if you
listen to me carefully. After all, lunatics happen to have
extraordinary ideas. We&#39;re listening. Here&#39;s my plan. It is when there&#39;s no hope  left that
you must not despair of anything. Now that you know why,
please welcome him. He&#39;s such a charming man. He used to go see you at the 
red cork but  never dared... What&#39;s his name? François De Rue-Pierre. He&#39;s very rich. Only the first contact
shall be painful. Lower your voice and i&#39;ll
take care of the rest. Don&#39;t be afraid, come on. Why does he want to see me?
To do a good deed? He has his poors in the neighborhood. No, only admiration made
him  come here. I don&#39;t like this kind
of courtesy call very much. I&#39;m going to welcome him. He&#39;s a shy guy, almost
silent. Don&#39;t ask im too many questions. He blushes like a girl. He really looks as if he has
suffered a lot too. How is he? Handsome but not my kind.
You&#39;d like him a lot. Beware Mr De Rue-Pierre. Your head. How kind of you to welcome me. This voice, Mireille! What&#39;s wrong Clarisse? Madere! He&#39;s gone again last week
with Gisele.  - So much the better. With his
 daughter too?  - I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry Mr, your voice
reminds me a little of.. You&#39;re not mistaken one&#39;s voice
for the first time. Don&#39;t you remember about Ulysse&#39;s voice?
- Yes, you&#39;re right. When you keep recalling 
the same memories...  But don&#39;t be afraid of me. I&#39;d feel much less embarassed
if you accept these.. Flowers! I can&#39;t! I wish you accepted something
much more embarassing. What is it? My friendship. I don&#39;t say no. See you soon Mr. What an educated and tactful man! Contrary to Madere! What&#39;s his kind exactly? A nice face. He looks like a prince. I feel much better after this visit. You won the first round! I &#39; m not afraid of loosing the last one. I have too much grief and 
joy at the same time. Such a scene at the new casino theater.. I&#39;d have messed it up. If all divorces were like that,
glaziers would be millionaires. Theres&#39; not even one clean
shirt left for Mr. I love to feel the sun on my skin. Mr has no money left. That&#39;s why she left. It doesn&#39;t matter, i&#39;m used to it. I&#39;ve never seen Mr so happy
in such a bad time. You&#39;re absolutly right ! Look Ulysse!  The rainbow, as you said. What a sublime comedy! You see , Clarisse, you should not
think about this man anymore, since he behaved so badly. If you want us to keep
getting along, let me dwell on the hate i feel for Madere. As you like. But i don&#39;t like to hear you saying you&#39;d kill him. - Why? - For no reason but i loath
any violence. - You&#39;re not like him. - A cigarette? You saw her hand touching his
while she took the cigarette? He was afraid, see the beads 
of sweat standing on his brow. They are becoming inseparable. You really did a wonderful job! If only you could see me at the new casino... Hearts! All is ready ! Ulysse wants the boat
&#39;s horn to be the signal if it&#39;s ok. What&#39;s happening on the &quot;noisy one &quot;? The big hit today,  their first lunch together ,
and Jeanette &#39;s coming! I only fear that the child makes
 everything crumble away . No Ulysse  planned it really fine and
he&#39;s the magicians&#39; king! When he has a blind audience ! I personally sent a turkey. On everybody&#39;s behalf of course. Isn&#39;t the coverlet for a
tablecloth too cheap? Not at all the table is marvellous! Come in! She looks even more
beautifull after all these dramas. Suffering has to be used to something. You&#39;re so beautiful today. A little too much powder may be.. Must be when i patted on my powder puff. You little coquette... A little Porto? - You should let me...- What? - Don&#39;t get angry. -Go on. take the doll away . He may find it strange that.. Never!  Violette will stay here until death comes. I swore it to myself. Only fools will find it strange. Mr De Ruepierre will understand
if he &#39;s hearted enough. What a good cooking smell Clarisse! It&#39;s a set of odd glasses. Mr De Ruepierre will offer us a 
set of baccarat crystal. I&#39;m sorry you made such a great
effort for me. She did her best to please you. They&#39;ll make you do the washing
soon believe me! I was only casually joking. Let&#39;s start!  An olive? This is calf&#39;s head. May i? Be careful Ulysse, you&#39;re
pouring wine in the sauce. Violette,  what would you have 
thought of such a meal? Violette ! What&#39;s going on? I&#39;m sorry i took the liberty of bringing  my daughter without asking you. You daughter?! Mr is alone in life and he has a charming little daughter whom he loves. Wouldn&#39;t you like my child to stand  in for your doll sometimes? You&#39;d see your daughter alive in her and she would  take you for her mother whom she needs so much. What&#39;s your name?    - Here it is!  - My love. This unexpected quitness in Clarisse&#39;s  life will make her so much good! She might see again!  Later with some cures...the 
Doctor told me so this morning! You&#39;re all retarded (?) This guy is a genius! What is he doing? He&#39;s planning for the week. He&#39;s got brains ! Too bad he loses them too often. &quot;The new manners&quot; Is it Mireille&#39;s part? So she&#39;s still in it? Of course, she&#39;s the pearl of the depths. And you play the oyster ! Don&#39;t let her go. I a miserable little actor and.... You&#39;re both disinherited so you might well... Don&#39;t talk crazy please! Where did you get the idea of making this &quot;golden&quot; trip for Clarisse? Once she told me in her dressing room : &quot;I feel grateful to everybody who  tries to show me that life isn&#39;t like how i see it. Even with tricks !&quot; - So...- You, Pierrot... You&#39;ve had a few joyful days  and now again, you&#39;re neurasthenic. The memories of this boat are depressing you. You should make a trip. Say yes dear. You&#39;re going to come with me on my yacht anchored at the port. In a while, we may go on a trip, in Egypt, in the Indies. Everywhere you wish! I&#39;ll tell you about all the
countries we&#39;re going to. I&#39;ll translate you
every languages. In Honolulu, I&#39;ll teach you the kulele! - Do you accept? - Oh yes. Here are your parts. Are we going to play? Of course. We&#39;re playing
The comedy of  happiness to Clarisse.
- Happiness to Venus. - I can&#39;t read. - Ok explain him. I&#39;m Chinese. Sort it out. What are you going to play? Later, later. We&#39;re going to make a first class artificial paradise for her. Everybody on the deck is at your disposal. Yesterday, i collected 300 francs from the customers. - See this. - All bought at the
flea market! Here they come! The trunks in the launch, Mireille and Ulysse on the other boat. Be careful with Jeanette ! - Are you happy to go? - Oh yes! My old &quot;noisy one &quot;, will we come back? Indigo, Rocquefort, Charlot, let&#39;s go! Only five minutes to
transform the &quot;noisy one &quot;! You&#39;ll take care of the noises 
and steerage imitation. Cybille, you will make single priced orientals along with your mobile bazaar
 and your arabians songs. Take away the hammock. The table.The chairs. Be carefull! Don&#39;t damage the boat! This is Gisele&#39;s perfume. You have
 a whole stock of it! What about this carpet. Only 25 fr 
and it looks like Persian! One last touch. That&#39;s it! - It&#39;s empty! - For Clarisse, there will be porcelain flowers from 
the kabyle emir in it. Hurry up, they&#39;re coming! Don&#39;t forget that now you&#39;re all sailors of the Primrose. Ulysse,
all&#39;s ready on the deck! Haul down the ropes! - Is it here? - The Primrose. 200 tons. You&#39;ll be here at home, dear madam. Cross the cable lugs!  - Music!? - I always have my orchestra aboard, and i thought that in order to
welcome you with more dignity..... I hope you&#39;ll have many more surprises on the Primrose. At attention! I&#39;ve had it made into a Pergola. - Marvelous! - Take a sit. Here the young one! Drink for the crew! What will you have? Malico!  Saumur! Medoc! .......Ricard! A glass of Champagne. A bit of Champagne! This is great! There&#39;s all you need! Your trick of ventriloquism. Now! Duvernay. Enough, enough. What i&#39;m most afraid of is that huge 1000 tons fridge
stuck to the &quot;noisy one &quot; like a leech! She&#39;ll know she hasn&#39;t moved
just by hanging her hand. Don&#39;t worry, Ulysse will
find an explanation. Lots of Champagne! Chef, what&#39;s the count&#39;s meal today? Meal of the day for the Count !
Salmon or thrushes? What about the pastries? The cream puffs and the flans are ready. What&#39;s the steerage to
get out of the port? Ready to cast off! Start the pulley&#39;s sheave! Cut the strop&#39;s basis! What&#39;s ahead of us, Mireille? A thousand of masts 
tangled together, a forest of the most
beautiful yachts. everything is quivering,
fluttering : the multicolore banners, the sparkling coppers,
the superb sailors in their uniforme for you and, as far as the eye can,
see the sea with thousands of ships and gulls playing hide and seek. It&#39;s beautiful! What a wonderful journey
 ahead of us, darling ! I feel so happy though i see nothing. It must be quite marvelous for you! Marvelous, darling. I&#39;m filled with joy. We are reaching the port entry and going to cast 
anchor for the night. - Ready? - Ready. Full steam ahead! Make it fast! Pull down the tackles! What an air! This smoky tar smell! How different from the &quot;noisy one &quot;! I feel like i live again! - What&#39;s wrong?-  Where is he going? He&#39;s rushing orders to an officer. She&#39;s let her hand in mine! - So what?-  Don&#39;t you understand? - No Now i&#39;m jealous of Mr Deruepierre! I didn&#39;t foresee that! You&#39;re getting totally crazy! I can&#39;t act anymore.
It hurts me too much. All the time, i feel like shouting :
&quot; you&#39;re being fooled!&quot; Don&#39;t you see that you&#39;re giving Clarisse the real hapiness 
for the first time maybe. It&#39;s like stealing to me. Fool, your vanity&#39;s speaking! You&#39;re jealous, as you said! Come on, don&#39;t you lose
your nerve! Let&#39;s show around her cabine. A true Arabian Nights tale. A general round of drinks! It&#39;s been a hard work with
lots of rehearsal. Now it&#39;s over. Clarise is in it up to the heart.
She swims in joy. - And Madère? - In his hapiness
rebuilding, he put all his strengh and tenderness,
on the go night and day. I&#39;m moved to tears. It is such a technical miracle, that everybody thinks he is on
 the primrose sailing towards Aden! - A still journey. - True! Everything&#39;s set sharp like in a
fairyland at the Chatelet theater. Everybody takes his turn and
the musicians are exhausted. We&#39;re crossing the red sea
in three days. Their cabines should  be heated up
to scorching hot. To their hapiness! Asia! We&#39;re sailing along the Syrian coast. It looks like Smyrne in the distance. Asia! 1B140 inhabitants!Cereal, wine, oil fruits, cotton, harsh climate in north! arid in the center, hot in east, We&#39;re at East!! Why are you laughing? Because of what the little one asked  me :  &quot; Why don&#39;t the boats move?&quot; She&#39;s too small to see the sea. That&#39;s it, on such a calm
 sea, nothing changes for her. Tell me exactly all
that you see, Mireille. Where&#39;s Madere? - Ulysse! - No one saw him? - No. Until now my friends, in order to save a woman,
you&#39;ve helped me to make dreams. Now, we must make reality
so that we can all live. What does he mean? That this comedy can&#39;t last forever  and that it&#39;s time to think
about real work. - He&#39;s right! -  Explain yourself! It costed my silly life Clarisse&#39;s
 drama for me to wake up. I feel like i can touch 
the stars with my hand. What should we do? Help me to repair the &quot;noisy one &quot;! Her heart is good and as soon as
i can sail the seven seas with cargo,  we&#39;ll go where Clarisse
believes we are. The &quot;noisy one &quot; will meet  the
Primrose in the southern seas! Reality will catch up with dream. This story will be famous! You&#39;ll all have a percent on
the expedition&#39;s benefits. The moral of the farmer and his 
children : a treasure is hidden in... go go go.. What&#39;s that bric-a-brac? Those are Turkish necklaces
which the kids sell in rowboats. These are Hawaiian 
records for Honolulu. You&#39;re extraordinary but 
what will you tell Clarisse about this hubbub, about this trafic? I told her that during the Smyrne
stop, we would clean the Primrose  and load tons of provisions
for the Pacific natives. - Tons you say! - It&#39;s all the same! Less noise down there! They&#39;re going to wake her up! Tell them to Speak Javanese up there! We were so well settled in dream
and you&#39;re gonna spoil it! - Idiot. Will you ever tell her
she&#39;s on the &quot;noisy one &quot;? Never. Madere died with Venus. It&#39;s a new man who
wants Clarisse back. I think it&#39;s done. Only Love can work such miracles! When do we go to... meet? At the end of the night, i hope. Ask for the latest song of the day! The lament of the blind Venus. Only 1 fr 50! What a beautiful story! Absolutely! All the town is talking! How this all started! Extraordinary! All together!   a man, a woman and love, and it ends like it starts. What do you see through the porthole?  Fishermen boats fitted into one another and it&#39;s written glory to God on it.  Glory to God! You can see!! No, but the darkness i was living in has faded since this morning. There are like light holes 
before me.  I can hardly see it. Haven&#39;t you just pass
your hand before me? Yes!!! I&#39;m no more in the night. I&#39;m in the snow. I see enough to make out
the white shadows of beings, and the smoke of things.... Goutard was right. You&#39;ll see. Maybe. I&#39;m not so much keen on it.
Believe me, Mireille. I&#39;m so happy as i am. Everything around me
is like a  moving music of lights . You don&#39;t know
 how marvellous it is ! Here, it&#39; like a still flame. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see, Clarisse. Don&#39;t cry like a kid. They&#39;ll be back some day. Come. It must be crowded on the dock. Come or we&#39;ll miss their departure. Arthur, don&#39;t forget to cash. Cast off the left ropes. So we&#39;re leaving ... Smyrne? Yes, in a few moments. - François.- Clarisse, what&#39;s wrong? Your face looks mysterious. Listen to the Primrose
pulling her anchor as if she wants to leave. Everything in life wants to leave. This why you must moor
your heart to mine. Tighter and tighter. Hapiness is awfully short. It&#39;s already over as 
you&#39;re talking about it. It&#39;s golden like the
fishermen oars in the sunset. Why are you saying these words? To test you. Ready? Let&#39;s leave them alone. This real departure of the &quot;noisy  one&quot; while she thinks she&#39;s leaving  Smyrne on the primrose with a Mr Derupierre ... It&#39;s too confused, i&#39;m afraid to flub. I&#39;m deeply moved too. She grasped my arm with such joy, that i almost bursted into tears. Full steam ahead! I&#39;ve often talked to you about Madere. If ever you meet him... You still want me to
get you rid of him? It will be easy... No. Forgive him as i do. Your eyes are looking at me! You see!! No. I don&#39;t see you my love 
but i&#39;ve guessed you. Your heart was too close to mine
and was beating too hard. It has betrayed you. I knew you by your heart! My little thing. You guessed it all. Yes my love. It&#39;s been so good to feel
all this goodness about me. Look! All the red dork is on the dock! The priest is blessing 
the departure. All these nice people. LIsten. Tell them i can see again.
They&#39;ll be so happy. Why? Isn&#39;t it the truth? It doesn&#39;t matter. Nice stories must end well 
for the people. Only this matters. A good end for all 
the stories of life. We will marry. Touch my heart. My love.. At the new casino.... Stay quiet or you&#39;d spoil the end. All the dying boats seem to flap  their swings to leave at their turn. How deeply moving, Ulysse!
