(We will counsel you on your unspeakable concerns.) We will counsel you on your unspeakable concerns. National... - Competition on Worries. / - Competition on Worries. Let me introduce today&#39;s panel. We have KBS&#39; most famous anchor. Please welcome Hwang Jungmin. Hello. The harmonious singers of Clazziquai, Alex and Ho Ran. - Hello. / - Hello. (Nice to meet you.) Jungmin, you host a radio show, right? Yes, on FM radio. I&#39;ve been doing it for 18 years now. I heard she gives out a lot of great advice. Whenever I watch this show on TV, I find myself thinking you lack a little something. - When you talk about couples... / - The wife&#39;s view. You need a married woman. - Are you saying I should be replaced? / - Add someone. - Get emotional as if this is your show. / - I will. - Please give valuable advice. / - Sure. What happens if someone asks your advice? I&#39;m the kind of person who listens intently and then gets angry towards the end. - We... / - You empathize too much. - I&#39;m a third party... / - You get angry. I get frustrated when the same things keep happening. - You get angry. / - You&#39;ll get angry today. I might because the last time I was on Hello Counselor, it wasn&#39;t caught on camera but I cursed a lot. - I was like that. / - That&#39;s true. The producer had a hard time editing your footage. (The producer had a hard time editing.) - Be careful. / - I should be more careful. Before we start the show, we must check in with last week&#39;s winner, &quot;Why Are You with Me?&quot; During a meal, he says, &quot;Let&#39;s have another baby.&quot; While watching TV, &quot;Shall we make another baby?&quot; He doesn&#39;t care about the kids, and he leaves all the housework to me. We have a rule. Men must never enter the kitchen. He goes out to drink seven days a week, and he mostly brings people back with him. Has your husband changed? Yes. The biggest change is when I&#39;m about to leave to take out the trash, he says, &quot;It&#39;s heavy, I&#39;ll take it out.&quot; He took out the trash. - I&#39;m impressed. / - But last week, - we filmed with a man obsessed with fish. / - Yes. My husband bought some fish and a hermit crab. (Another worry is added to her.) - Out of the blue. / - He did what? I was impressed and realized what I was missing. I bought guppies which are known to breed well. That&#39;s why I chose guppies. I&#39;m hoping my wife will learn from them. Will you use them to beg for another baby? - Yes. / - It got worse. I hope that appearing on our show brings about some positive change. We&#39;ll see if they win today. What do the winners get? - They get a 1,000-dollar gift certificate. / - Right. This is titled, &quot;Am I a Chef?&quot; Hello. I&#39;ve been married for five years to a husband who looks just like I do. My husband and I have the same name, - the same blood type, / - The same name? and we even look alike. There&#39;s just one thing we&#39;re polar opposites about. It&#39;s what we eat. Because of that, my husband has gained 10kg and I&#39;ve lost 10kg since we got married. &quot;Honey, I made doenjang jjigae and spinach namul.&quot; &quot;Come and eat.&quot; &quot;Is this all we have to eat? Forget it.&quot; &quot;I want meat and ham!&quot; &quot;Give me meat!&quot; I don&#39;t mind grilling him a few slices of meat. I can do that. However, he demands I cook fresh rice and soup for every meal. I even have to prepare fresh side dishes. I&#39;m losing my mind here. Say my mom prepares a feast for him. &quot;Here, have some japchae. Eat all you want.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t eat things like this.&quot; He even does this. &quot;What&#39;s this smell?&quot; &quot;Spiced cucumbers? Get this off the table.&quot; &quot;Vegetables are not allowed on my table.&quot; &quot;If you want vegetables, eat on the floor.&quot; - What? / - Vegetables go on the floor? I ended up putting the spiced cucumbers on the floor and had to eat alone. &quot;Do you think I&#39;m your chef?&quot; &quot;Eat what you&#39;re given before I upset the table, okay?&quot; That&#39;s it. What did you think of that? Liking different food is worse - than having different personalities. / - It is. It&#39;s really hard if you like different food. Let&#39;s meet the lady who cooks three times a day and is having a tough time with it. (Whose husband is a picky eater?) (Oh, my goodness.) She&#39;s so thin. (She&#39;s stick-thin.) She&#39;s so thin. - Oh no. / - She&#39;s really thin. Take off your shoes. - You&#39;re so thin. / - My goodness. - Oh my. / - You two look so different. - Why are you so thin? / - She&#39;s so thin. Did you lose weight after marriage? - She lost 10kg. / - Weigh her for us. - Me? / - Yes. Excuse me. May I? - She&#39;s good at this. / - This is insane. (It looks so easy.) (She can carry her with one hand.) - 48kg? / - Oh no. No, 38kg. - 38kg? / - Really? - 38? / - That&#39;s how much primary school kids weigh. I can hold her with one arm. When did you last weigh 38kg? (How dare you.) When you were five? (He starts squealing.) Stupid me. I knew she&#39;d kick me for it. (He regrets.) Does your husband really make you eat on the floor? If I put vegetables on the table, he yells, &quot;Why put this here? You know I don&#39;t eat it.&quot; - Kimchi has a unique pungent smell. / - It does. He treats it like poison and that goes on the floor. He thinks kimchi is poison? My husband only eats ham and meat. - Ham and meat? / - Yes. Not just one kind of ham. - Spam, sausages... / - Garlic-flavored sausages. He requires at least three kinds. Three different kinds of ham per meal? Yes. I have to cook rice for each meal, and the soup has to be different, too. - So I... / - Hang on. - Say he left some ham. / - Yes. Will he eat it if you reheat it? - No. / - I doubt it. - No? / - No. - Really? / - Does he want something else? - What about soup? / - If I make kimchi jjigae, - he picks out the ham or meat. / - Or tuna? He eats only the chunks of tuna. With yukgaejang, he won&#39;t eat ready-made food. - Do you cook? / - I have to. - That&#39;s a hassle. / - Yukgaejang takes a while. - For one meal. / - Just a meal? I eat the rest until I&#39;m sick of it and throw it away. We asked her to take a few photos of what they eat. Let&#39;s have a look. (The husband&#39;s table) They eat separately. (There&#39;s a huge difference.) Did you set it out like this on purpose? - This can&#39;t be true. / - Wait. - Whose are the tiny utensils? / - This is incredible. - My child&#39;s. / - Their kid&#39;s. I have a feeling the kid should be at this table. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. What was the soup we just saw? That&#39;s yukgaejang. - I don&#39;t see any vegetables. / - There&#39;s none. He must just drink the soup. - This is weird. / - The soup and meat. (Ham and meat three times a day) - Jihyun. / - Isn&#39;t that greasy? - He never eats the same thing twice. / - Right. Can he eat that in one sitting? It&#39;s a lot. If I don&#39;t serve that much, he says I don&#39;t try. He likes seeing a lot of food. - This is crazy. / - One day, he ate at a restaurant in Jeonju. They serve 50 to 60 side dishes. - He noticed that, didn&#39;t he? / - Come on. After he came back, he told me to make 20 to 30 dishes. - Side dishes? / - He doesn&#39;t eat a lot. - How, when he won&#39;t eat vegetables? / - How? I said I can&#39;t with the limited amount of meat. &quot;I worked all day. Can&#39;t you do that much?&quot; - He said that. / - Really? - What then? / - Then, we ended up in a fight and pulled each other&#39;s hair. Do you pull out each other&#39;s hair? That&#39;s rare. She pulled his out, I think. We can&#39;t understand, so let&#39;s meet the husband. Where are you? Hello. (Here&#39;s the picky eater) (who demands newly cooked meat only.) - He&#39;s quite slim. / - He isn&#39;t fat. Could you stand up and turn around? - He looks normal. / - I expected you to be fat. - Me, too. / - Not too bad for a meat-lover. He looks too healthy. Why are you such a picky eater? - Why? / - Why only meat and ham? - Everyone / - Yes? - likes different kinds of foods. / - That&#39;s true. My wife likes vegetables and fruit. I like ham and meat. That&#39;s all I eat and I&#39;m healthy and well. How old are you? - I&#39;m 32. / - 32? Ever since you were a child... - They&#39;re whispering. / - Wait. (They&#39;re shocked.) - What was that? / - You shouldn&#39;t be so mean. Don&#39;t you think you are too mean? He said he&#39;s 32, and they&#39;re like, &quot;He&#39;s only 32?&quot; - What? / - Not to his face, please. That&#39;s mean. I was shocked, too, but I tried to move on. Did you always eat only ham? Say, since you were seven or eight? No, no. I had meningitis when I was five. The doctor told my father to feed me meat for a year, and my father did exactly as he was told. I ate meat for a year and ended up like this. Are you blaming your father? My father made a huge mistake. Do you not eat any vegetables? Not at all. - Never? / - Never. If someone stir-fried strips of ham and potato, would you eat that? - Just the ham. / - Even then? - Just the ham. / - Then, - sausages with vegetables. / - Yes. - Do you eat those? / - No. - No? / - I don&#39;t eat sausages with peppers. - Just ham. / - You know what you want. What about garlic ham? - I eat that. / - I know that. That&#39;s my favorite. That&#39;s ham with a hint of garlic. The garlic isn&#39;t in chunks. - You work at the moment. / - Yes. How do you manage at lunchtime? Even when I&#39;m eating with the CEO or a superior, I tell them outright what I don&#39;t eat. Does the kimchi go on the floor? No, that&#39;s just wrong. Why do that at home, then? Family is different. That&#39;s wrong. What do you think about wasting food? Why do you want so much on the table? A little will do. I get a bit greedy. - How? / - He can&#39;t eat it all, but he wants a lot. The more I have in front of me, the tastier it looks. - But it goes in the bin. / - Isn&#39;t it a waste? I think that&#39;s terrible. (I think that&#39;s terrible.) Why do you... (Did he just admit that he&#39;s wrong?) I have a feeling your mother would&#39;ve tried to feed you vegetables when you were a child. No one did. Did your mother cook fresh rice, soup, and meat for you for every meal? - Did she? / - No, no. - Now you&#39;re married. / - Yes. Where did you get the belief that you deserve this? (Where did you get the belief?) I think she can do that much for me if she loves me. If you love your wife... (It works the other way.) Can&#39;t you eat on the floor? I didn&#39;t think that far. (I didn&#39;t think that far.) Would you be willing to eat on the floor? Not right now. He&#39;s very... But vegetables... The spiced cucumber... That was a misunderstanding. - Let&#39;s hear it. / - Tell us. I don&#39;t tell her to put every vegetable on the floor. I hate pungent smells. - Mature kimchi? / - Very mature kimchi. She put it on the table knowing I hate the smell. I told her to move it. Do you feel like throwing up? I don&#39;t like the smell. It ruins my appetite. How do you feel when you see her eat on the floor? She seems fine. (He&#39;s mean.) - On the floor? / - Yes. (How could he say that?) You even refused the food your mother-in-law made. Don&#39;t you think of your wife? I feel like throwing up if I eat vegetables. - I don&#39;t feel well. / - Really? If my mother-in-law offered me food - and I&#39;d gag... / - You think it&#39;s politer - to refuse food in advance. / - That&#39;s right. - Yes. / - Say your wife&#39;s mother cooked vegetables. How do you refuse it? - Talk to her. / - Say I&#39;m your mother-in-law. - Try some. / - I don&#39;t eat this. (I don&#39;t eat this.) I made japchae just for you. I don&#39;t like that. - Have this, then. / - No. You little... (That&#39;s not being polite.) How do you feel when he says he can&#39;t eat your mother&#39;s food? - How did you feel? / - I was very angry. After we came home, I asked how could he refuse food from an elder, my mother, his mother-in-law. He said it&#39;s worse to force-feed what he can&#39;t eat. What did your mother say? - She doesn&#39;t want to cook for him now. / - I see why. - She wouldn&#39;t want to. / - He doesn&#39;t even try. - Are you her mother? / - Yes. - Hello. / - Hello. Welcome. You cooked for your son-in-law and he refused the food. How did that feel? It&#39;s indescribable. It gets worse, though. When he visits relatives and they serve vegetables, he says outright that he won&#39;t eat with them. - Oh my. / - I hate him so much. If there&#39;s no meat at all on the table, he leaves saying he wants to buy something and eats at a restaurant. It&#39;s incredible. She said incredible. He&#39;s incredible. I&#39;ve all but given up on him. Your daughter&#39;s lost 10kg since she got married. I feel sorry for her. She loves cheonggukjang, namul, doenjang jjigae. - That&#39;s delicious. / - She comes to my restaurant. That&#39;s when she eats her fill. - She... / - Do you cook? - At your restaurant? / - Yes. I steam some vegetables and cook cheonggukjang for her. That&#39;s what my daughter likes. It&#39;s easier in a way. Just grill him a few sausages. - What? / - That&#39;s true. &quot;Eat this.&quot; Meat doesn&#39;t agree with me. If I eat meat, I get sick or throw up. Do you really? I visit my in-laws twice a week. - What? / - That often? - Do they live nearby? / - We live in the same area. My father-in-law wants to feed my husband meat, so we go to a beef restaurant. Oh my. - To eat out? / - Yes. When I was pregnant, my in-laws took us to eat meat. I started feeling sick that evening and cried for four hours. I was in a lot of pain, but my husband was drunk and couldn&#39;t wake up. When you were sick? - So sick you were in tears? / - I took a taxi, went to a hospital, got an IV drip and came home. He said, &quot;Why does meat make you sick?&quot; - That&#39;s not comforting. / - I kept losing weight. He said it&#39;s because I don&#39;t eat meat. He said, &quot;Eat meat.&quot; Offering something that makes her throw up... - Vegetables don&#39;t make you vomit. / - No. You express your likes and dislikes. Can&#39;t you be a bit more considerate for her? I feel terrible about that. Is that it? It&#39;s not just the food. It&#39;s also the stress. - That&#39;s true. / - Does he eat tofu? - He does. / - Does he? - A lot? / - That&#39;s odd. If I buy one block of tofu, I throw out two-thirds. He leaves the rest. Why waste that? If she took it out of the fridge and cooked it, - you can eat it. / - I won&#39;t. - Why not? / - I think it&#39;ll be rotten. Oh my... Did that ever happen? Did you eat something bad - and get violently sick? / - Are you traumatized? Not really, but I don&#39;t like pungent smells - and food from the fridge just smells. / - Tofu is kept in water. Will he not eat anything that came - from the fridge? / - It has to be freshly cooked. Rice and soup included. That must be so much work. In the evening he always orders something like chicken. About six times a week. - That often? / - I have to put up with the smell. In the end we have to throw away the leftovers. Having food delivered often must cost a lot. - Chicken six times a week... / - In a month, he spends 1,000 dollars on food. (He spends 1,000 dollars for chicken per month.) - No way. / - On delivery? Fried chicken&#39;s expensive. - It is. / - 15 dollars per chicken at least. - That&#39;s expensive. / - Some are 23 dollars. On weekends, he eats all three meals at home. Does he order chicken three times? In the evening, he orders one to eat with beer. - During the day, it&#39;s pork cutlet. / - Other things. - For breakfast... / - Stir-fried pork? We live off a set salary. - When we&#39;re short... / - Exactly. One time, I had to buy our kid some shoes. I couldn&#39;t because we were in debt. - Because of fried chicken? / - Yes. - The delivery... / - The chicken and ham. I didn&#39;t know she couldn&#39;t buy our kid&#39;s shoes. I just found out today. I thought that we all have shoes to wear and a person should eat what they want. - We can&#39;t all do what we want. / - Of course. Don&#39;t you feel bad or guilty as the breadwinner? I do, but when I look in the fridge and there&#39;s nothing to eat, I wonder if I should order in. Why is there nothing to eat? There&#39;s ham and other side dishes to choose from. It&#39;s what I had for dinner or breakfast. I need to wait three days to eat the same dish again. Do you think everyone does that? - No. / - Do you know you&#39;re weird? Yes. I know it&#39;s very wrong. You just say you know it. It&#39;s really hard to cook different soup for each meal. Jihyun, what&#39;s your biggest concern? My husband gained about 10kg. He once ended up in the ER in the early morning. The doctor suggested an endoscopy, but he refused saying he&#39;s young. Why didn&#39;t you drag him to the hospital? If I do, he says he&#39;ll go out to make a call. - Does he just leave? / - He disappears. - He&#39;s cheeky. / - He&#39;s a kid. - Did you see a doctor? / - Yes. How did the doctor describe your condition? He said I have gastritis and acid reflux. He told me to eat - less meat, more vegetables. / - Right. I said I was allergic to vegetables. I sometimes turn red if I eat vegetables. I get hives sometimes. - Not always. / - Get an allergy test. I want to get an allergy test, but if they say I&#39;m not allergic to vegetables, then things will get awkward. - You&#39;ll have no excuse. / - Correct. Why did you refuse the endoscopy? I was scared. (I was scared.) - He&#39;s scared. / - About what? I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll say I&#39;m sick. Do you think your diet is bad? I do think that - my diet isn&#39;t ideal. / - Don&#39;t you want a change? If you&#39;re that scared? Not yet because I&#39;ve never actually been sick. People who are on a meat-heavy diet - have a high risk of colon cancer. / - Yes. Eating too much meat can cause stroke, heart disease, and lead to early death. Must you insist on eating meat only? - Yes, because my heart so far... / - Let&#39;s say you were diagnosed with one of those. - Then it&#39;s too late to change. / - It is. Rather than to wait until then, why don&#39;t you try to eat vegetables now? - Isn&#39;t that better? / - He knows that. He knows those facts. He just won&#39;t follow them. He knows everything and knows it&#39;s wrong. Did you ever consider doing something extreme - to shock him into changing? / - Did you? I did. I did try. I once left with our kid and went to a motel. - To a motel? / - Across the road. He called the next day and begged that he&#39;d done wrong. - He apologized. / - He&#39;s good at that. - He knows he did wrong. / - So I went home. But nothing changed and that causes me more stress. How did you feel when she left? I didn&#39;t know it was about food. I came home drunk and I guess I said something wrong. She was gone the next morning. I saw her car outside the motel. - Did you get her? / - I apologized and came home. - Well done. / - Thanks. - Be glad the passcode&#39;s the same. / - My goodness. She says you keep apologizing but nothing changes. Why do you go back on what you say? When it comes to my personality or smoking, I can fix that, but not what I like to eat. - That&#39;s tough. / - Is it? - Did you quit smoking? / - No. Your wife is struggling. Did you try anything? To appease her. I express my love. - How? / - I express my love. Show us how. I love you. (I love you.) (We added this in advance.) That means nothing. - That sounded so insincere. / - My goodness. How do you feel? When you hear that. - I think he&#39;s trying to avoid a fight. / - To get out. He&#39;s very clever. Why don&#39;t you save up and leave him? (You should save up and leave.) You should be more decisive. - I would... / - Is that a solution? Did she do anything to upset you? - A lot. / - Like what? She gets very upset about very little things. This is true. I was going to write to your show, but she beat me to it. Give us an example. - What does she do? / - An example. Say I&#39;m leaving for work. When I say, &quot;I&#39;m off to work.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Go!&quot; - I did nothing wrong. / - Hang on. - I think / - What? you did something to deserve that. - I did nothing wrong. / - That&#39;s impossible. &quot;I&#39;m off to work.&quot; &quot;Go!&quot; That&#39;s nonsense. Something must have happened the night before. Why did you yell at him as he left for work? The night before, he came home drunk and upset me. - He just sleeps it off. / - And remembers nothing. - He forgets it all. / - &quot;I&#39;m off to work.&quot; When he acted like nothing was wrong, I got so annoyed. - Re-enact what happened. / - Show us. - You, go. / - You&#39;re leaving. - I&#39;m off to work. / - Go! (She sounds really annoyed.) - That&#39;s what happened. / - You upset her. He thinks nothing&#39;s wrong. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; (What&#39;s wrong with her?) I think you need professional help. Like counseling. Did you get one? - Yes, we tried that. / - Together? He applied for it. - Did he? / - That wasn&#39;t me. Because she yelled, &quot;Go&quot;? - Because of that? / - In general, our relationship is really good. (It&#39;s really good.) And she yelled at you? That&#39;s rare, but I wanted us to get closer, - so I applied for a session. / - You tried. The counselor told me to drink less and told my wife to be less edgy. I&#39;m trying very hard to drink less, but she hasn&#39;t changed. Your wife&#39;s concern is that you only eat meat. - Meat and ham. / - Yes. Did the counselor mention that? He said - I should try to eat what others eat. / - Of course. I understand to an extent that it&#39;s your preference. The problem is that you demand too much from her. - It&#39;s hard. / - New food every meal. It&#39;s the equivalent of you working hard and her nagging that you earn too little. - That you should make twice more. / - What if she whined that you make too little? Then she&#39;d be a terrible wife. Go! (That&#39;s what you&#39;re like.) (That felt so good.) He looked scared. (That startled me.) Our child has some developmental issues - and needs speech therapy. / - I see. - The cost is a lot to handle. / - I&#39;m sure. - That&#39;s true. / - My husband thinks it&#39;s his money and he can eat what he wants. For your child&#39;s sake, - Yes? / - could you eat less? I can do that. Don&#39;t just say it. You have to do it. I can promise. You answered in front of so many people. - Yes. / - Will you allow kimchi on the table? - He&#39;s so frustrating. / - Kimchi? Try eating food that came out of the fridge. It&#39;s such a waste. Almost everyone in the world takes food from the fridge, heats it up, and eats. - Everyone does that. / - That&#39;s true. That&#39;s why we rejoiced when the fridge was invented. Why else would we use a fridge? Everything you order came from a fridge. That&#39;s true. The food is fine. Your mindset is rotten. (That felt so good.) I don&#39;t ask much, so... - You do ask for too much. / - You do. Can&#39;t a wife make soup? What do you think a fridge is for? It&#39;s to keep food from rotting. (It&#39;s to keep food from rotting.) You said you don&#39;t like food that came from the fridge. If you order chicken, they don&#39;t kill, pluck, and fry it. They don&#39;t do that. - No chicken place does that. / - No way. I don&#39;t see what kind of chicken they fried. Would you eat side dishes if they were deep-fried? Maybe, if they are freshly made. So, if there&#39;s some leftover ham in the fridge, would you eat it if your wife cooked it again - in egg wash? / - I&#39;d eat that. Would you eat leftover ham cooked in gochujang? - Yes. / - With cucumber kimchi? - Would you eat that? / - No. Your wife can&#39;t cook that every time. - Every day. / - The cucumber kimchi&#39;s to blame. Let&#39;s vote. Alex. - He&#39;s like a kid. / - This is a huge worry. I think it&#39;s less about preference and more about - the lack of his sense of responsibility. / - Right. The money he earns isn&#39;t solely for him. - It should be spent on the family. / - That&#39;s right. - I think you should be more considerate. / - Okay. I also think this is a worry. Quit saying you&#39;ll change. It&#39;s time to take action. It&#39;s like hitting someone. &quot;What was that for?&quot; &quot;Sorry.&quot; Then you hit again. &quot;Why did you hit me?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; Then again. If you think it&#39;s a worry, press your button. (What does the audience think?) - Five, four, three, / - Five, four, three, - two, one. / - two, one. - Stop. / - Okay. - I can&#39;t believe that ham... / - Towards the end, a lot of people just gave in and voted. - Towards the end. / - Mister. What did you whisper during the vote? &quot;Why are so many people voting?&quot; That&#39;s how serious this issue is. Be very honest. Say only what you mean. I will try to eat maybe some radish side dishes that you like so much. Try reheating some ham. - With egg. / - Heat it up. - Recycle leftover ham. / - Reheat and recycle. - With egg wash. / - Okay. Let&#39;s see what the result is. (The result) It&#39;s going up. Is it 158, 168 or 178? Is it a tie? Will we have joint winners? Will we? (Am I a Chef?) 148, that was close. We hope there will be a change. &quot;He&#39;ll explode if I touch it.&quot; It&#39;s a story from a woman in her 70s. Hello. I live with my son, my daughter-in-law and my grandson. I&#39;m 73 years old. I teach my daughter-in-law on how to do the chores and take care of my grandson. However, pleasing my 50-year-old son is the hardest part. He&#39;s a neat freak. If I try to use his computer, he&#39;ll ask me if I washed my hands. &quot;Wash your hands, then use my computer.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll need to use your right hand for the mouse,&quot; &quot;so wear those gloves over there.&quot; - Excuse me? / - I have no idea why he&#39;s doing that. &quot;Son, I cleaned up all your luggage.&quot; &quot;What? Why did you touch my stuff?&quot; &quot;Who told you to do so?&quot; I already cleaned his stuff, but he was still wiping everything with wet tissues. Even my daughter-in-law from the Philippines said, &quot;Mother, my husband is strange.&quot; &quot;I did his laundry, and he got upset.&quot; &quot;He gets upset if I touch his cell phone.&quot; &quot;Why did he marry me? He&#39;s so strange.&quot; - What kind of accent is that? / - Hold on. Where is this woman really from? All my family walks on eggshells because my son is obsessed with cleanliness. Could anyone please fix my son? - That&#39;s her story. / - I see. Is there anyone here who can relate to this man in the story? I&#39;m a bit like him. You aren&#39;t as bad as this person, though. That&#39;s right, - but I used to be like him before. / - Really? Since I made food for my friends when they visited my place, they offered to do the dishes. I watched them from the back. - You checked how they were doing. / - Once done, they went home, I did them again. I felt better that way. It&#39;s possible, - but this man does it to his mom. / - That&#39;s right. She&#39;s now 73 years old. - She sent the story via internet / - That&#39;s right. with gloves on her hands. - She&#39;s struggling because of her son. / - He ignores. Let&#39;s welcome the mother. (Who is this lady struggling because of her son?) (Kim Ryoungja) Come down slowly. (Welcome to Hello Counselor.) Ma&#39;am, did you request to be on the show by yourself? - Do you use computer often? / - I&#39;m quite good at it. I worked at a company for quite some time. Whenever I try to use computer, my son keeps telling me, &quot;Mother, wash your hands first.&quot; When you hold the mouse, - you have to wear a glove. / - Glove. - It&#39;s uncomfortable to use it. / - You&#39;re right. Whenever he uses the computer, he brings a towel that I boiled and dips it in water. He wipes the desk, the mouse and the keyboard. He wipes everything before using the computer. He also wipes them all after use. Does he wash his hands often, too? He washes his hands way too often. He washes them before and after leaving the house. When he goes to drive his own car, - there are two bottles of water / - In the car? - he keeps in his trunk. / - Two bottles of water? - Yes, he fills them up. / - To wash his hands? Since he needs to touch the car when opening the door, he washes his hands right after opening it. - Then, he drives. / - He washes his hands then? That&#39;s how he grabs the handle. You can&#39;t ride his car, then. That&#39;s right. When I was about to drive his car, he gave me a pair of gloves. &quot;Mother, drive with these gloves on.&quot; - She must have struggled. / - Has he been this way - since he was young? / - He prepared for the bar exam. He kept failing at the second round. He was daunted and intimidated. Then, he began washing his hands on and on. - That was his way of expression. / - He kept... There are preconceptions upon hearing her story. - He sounds like a skinny, sharp man. / - A sharp one. - He sounds sensitive. / - That&#39;s right. However, he doesn&#39;t look like that in person. Let&#39;s meet her son. Hello. Hello. Hello. He does look like an examinee for the bar exam. - That&#39;s right. / - Sir. Was that to avoid getting something on your hands? - That&#39;s not it. / - I see. It&#39;s because I&#39;m nervous. He placed his hand on the floor afterwards. Then he got frightened and closed his hand right away. - I see. / - I&#39;m serious. You&#39;ll wash your hands later, right? Yes, I need to wash them afterwards. How many times do you wash your hands? When I counted, I washed them about 30 to 40 times a day. Everything has been contaminated. (Everywhere is contaminated for him.) - Are we all polluted, then? / - Are they all dirty? My pen and my mouse on my desk are considered clean. Other than those, I consider everything else a bit dirty. Once I touch them, I need to wash my hands to feel better. What if a person wants to shake hands with you? - You do shake hands, right? / - That&#39;s true. There&#39;s a spray bottle on my desk. So after shaking hands with superiors at work (Do you sanitize whenever you shake hands?) I spray my hands afterwards. Why don&#39;t you just greet like how you did earlier with your fist? Like this. (Greet others in a hip-hop style.) - We&#39;re all contaminated now? / - You&#39;re now holding a microphone with your left hand. How do you feel? - I have already been... / - You&#39;ve been contaminated. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s already happened. Before I go home, I must wash my hands. Do you want some wet tissues? No, I&#39;ve already been... I&#39;m okay. - Pass him the wet tissues. / - I will. You feel uncomfortable. - You&#39;re upset. / - What a stomp. (Her stomp is loud enough to break the stage.) I told the staff to sterilize the microphone. What a stomp. - I thought the stage would collapse. / - It is my first time to wipe the microphone in six years. Open your hands. (Her customer service is impeccable.) - To me... / - Yeongja, you&#39;re holding the microphone! (My mistake!) - Cover the microphone with it. / - That&#39;s it. - I think he won&#39;t be happy with / - Be careful. - others wiping it. / - He must have his own method. - He needs to wipe it. / - There must be a way. (She wipes the area around him.) Yeongja, he&#39;s a bit intimidated by you. Come back now. All right. - He&#39;s scared of her. / - Thank you. She was saying earlier that you have become a neat freak since you studied for the bar exam. Do you feel that something has changed since then? I think it started since I was young. It was probably since I was in middle school. I washed all my pens before studying. Did you wash all your pens? - Yes. / - It was like a ritual to get you focused. I had a washbowl filled with water beside my desk. I washed my hands whenever they were a bit sticky. People say that you become a bit slow as you age. However, I became worse with time. I&#39;m getting exhausted. - That&#39;s right. / - You&#39;d like to fix it. How did you manage when you were in the military? When you were in the military... There isn&#39;t much you can do when you&#39;re in the army, so I resigned and accepted the reality. You must&#39;ve changed when you were discharged, then. After I was discharged from the army, - it became worse than before. / - They escaped. It became worse than before. - You endured when you were in the army. / - Yes. It means you can endure it if you&#39;re really determined. Once I was out, I didn&#39;t have to mind others. I became nervous, and I was under a lot of stress. - That&#39;s right. / - I can&#39;t do anything else. While listening to him, I realized something about myself. I have a spray bottle filled with alcohol at home. (Is Alex a neat freak as well?) - Where do you spray it? / - Slippers. - It&#39;s possible. / - Slippers that guests wore. - What other people wore. / - You sterilize them. Before cleaning the floor, others use water or a damp cloth to wipe those. - I spray my floor with alcohol. / - You spray alcohol. Do you feel uncomfortable if others touch your stuff? - No. / - You wash your body, though. - I do wash my body. / - Do you feel uncomfortable? Yes, I do. (Yes, I feel uncomfortable.) He&#39;s not any better. - It&#39;s another type of discomfort. / - It&#39;s different. - What are you talking about? / - It&#39;s different. Isn&#39;t it better than being dirty? It&#39;s better than not cleaning at all. - He&#39;s excessive. / - He&#39;s excessive. What I find strange is that during summer, when it&#39;s hot like this year, it&#39;d be nice if he washes his body, - but he doesn&#39;t. / - Seriously? (What is this now?) - Doesn&#39;t he take a shower at night? / - He will - at night. / - No, he doesn&#39;t. He comes home late at night. What is this now? - That would be icky. / - No way. - He only washes the visible parts? / - Yes. - Why is that? / - Is your trunk the cleanest part? - He doesn&#39;t need a shower. / - It&#39;s not polluted. My trunk doesn&#39;t make direct contact with pollutants. It&#39;s my clothes and hands that touch pollutants. I just need to wash the parts that made contact. My clothes cover my trunk, so showering once a week would suffice. (Showering once a week would suffice.) - Once a week? / - I thought it was an issue of cleanliness, but I guess it&#39;s not all true. What if you sweat? In that case, I wash my hands, my hair and my face. Since you didn&#39;t make contact with pollutants or others, since it&#39;s your sweat, it&#39;s okay? - In order for your son to shower, / - Bacteria. you need to touch your son&#39;s body. How far does she need to touch his body? Never mind. (I didn&#39;t think that through.) He only washes the parts that touch other things. For example, you sit on a toilet. - Your bums are exposed. / - Do you sit on a toilet? I do. - He cleans the toilet first. / - With a towel, - I wipe the toilet seat first. / - I see. - &quot;It&#39;s been sterilized, so I can sit.&quot; / - That&#39;s it. Do you clean everything on your own - Good question. / - from beginning to end? I had my own room before marriage. I always had it locked. I didn&#39;t want my mother to go in my room and clean while I was gone. Since we live together now, my mother and my wife clean the house, but I ask them not to touch my belongings like my book, my phone and so forth. He only wipes his own things. When it comes to laundry, he does his own laundry separately. - Does he do it himself? / - We&#39;re not allowed. If our clothes are mixed, he takes them out. Then, he washes his clothes again. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. Do you also wipe the washing machine? My clothes are sterilized with the laundry detergent, - so wiping it isn&#39;t necessary. / - Wait. Why wash separately? All clothes will be sterilized. Washing all the clothes together is okay, but once the laundry is done, - they lay all the clothes on the floor, / - To fold. then hang them. Laying the wet clothes on such a place makes the laundry meaningless. (Seriously, what happened to my son?) There&#39;s a window near the hanger. The wind that blows from the west is very refreshing, so I&#39;d like to open that window. However, my son taped it so nobody can open it. &quot;Mother, don&#39;t open that window.&quot; &quot;The laundry will be covered with dust.&quot; This summer was really hot. I told Yunah that we should open the window while he&#39;s gone. I removed the tape and opened it. - Then, cool wind blew inside. / - It must be cool. - Even we find it cool. / - That&#39;s right. - I can feel the wind from here. / - Really. I felt it, too. It&#39;s like air conditioning. I was going to tape it again before my son came back, - but I forgot. / - My goodness. I went out to eat with my daughter-in-law and grandson, - since it was hot. / - She went out and left it open. My son called me while we were eating. His voice was very low. &quot;I told you not to open the window. Why did you do it?&quot; I was surprised and turned pale. I know that it was wrong to lose my temper as a child. - However, / - He was seriously distressed. when I saw the window open once I came home, I couldn&#39;t think of anything else. I was enraged because she touched my belonging. It kept on reiterating and I got irritated at myself. If my mother can cooperate... That&#39;s how I feel. I think it&#39;s cooperation. Besides, he&#39;s married. He has a child, too. Do you wipe your hands after holding your child&#39;s hand? What happens afterwards is the meaningful part. I don&#39;t need to wash my hands after making contact with my wife or play with my child. However, if someone calls after I play with my child, - I must wash my hands. / - Before you take the call. Wouldn&#39;t they hang up? - Sometimes, they do. / - I thought so. - It takes time. / - So you make the call again? That&#39;s right. I need to make the call again. The lady beside him seems like his wife. Hello. - Hello. / - Hello. (She&#39;s the daughter-in-law.) How long have you been in Korea? - It&#39;s been six years. / - Her pronunciation is great. Were you scolded for touching your husband&#39;s laundry? Yes. He tells me not to touch his laundry. - He doesn&#39;t let you. / - We do laundry separately. Is there anything else that he doesn&#39;t let you touch? There is. He doesn&#39;t let me touch his cell phone. Does he apologize for doing that, then? - No. / - He gets angry instead. When are you most upset with him? When I delivered my baby... - Yes, I had a baby. / - When you delivered your baby? It makes you upset when you see him keep on washing his hands after playing with your child? That&#39;s right. It&#39;s upsetting. I see why that&#39;s upsetting. I asked her to excuse me. I told her I&#39;ve been this way since before marriage. I&#39;ve lived this way for most of my life. I can&#39;t fix it even though I want to. - &quot;I hope you understand, Honey.&quot; / - I understand you. I don&#39;t know if she has resigned or given up on me. You mentioned that it was your illness. - He said it himself. / - You must have visited a specialist or a counselor. I have seen a psychiatrist. After consultation, the doctor prescribed medication. However, it only made me sleepy. (The medication only made him sleepy.) - He washes even when he&#39;s sleepy. / - He&#39;s sleepy. It only made it harder for him. I didn&#39;t find it effective at all, so I stopped seeing the psychiatrist. I can totally empathize with him. Don&#39;t you feel that you lack your own space? That&#39;s how I felt. That&#39;s why I was uncomfortable with others invading my space. I recovered from it, and how I did it was by reducing my psychological space. - When my friends visited, / - You reduced your space. I let my friends use all the space in the living room. Now, I&#39;m okay with everything - but my car. / - It&#39;s your car now. I wipe my car with a cotton swab. - With a cotton swab? / - How much time... I can relate to what Alex said. My space now are the drawer where I keep my belongings and the hanger where I hang my clothes. - All I need is my mother and my wife / - I see. not to touch my space. I wouldn&#39;t lose temper that way. Sir, what you said just now is wrong. You said that your space is only your drawer and a few things, but you&#39;re controlling the whole house. - She mentioned the window. / - But that... Everyone would die from heat without opening it. - That&#39;s not your space. / - There are other windows. That&#39;s where the wind blew, though. Even though you think so, you&#39;re actually controlling the whole house. You keep saying that it&#39;s your house, but it should be &quot;our house&quot; instead. (It&#39;s &quot;our house.&quot;) We asked a few specialists concerning your situation. You need to let others touch your things and touch them yourself. With practice, you&#39;ll realize that nothing happens. That&#39;s how you can recover gradually. Forget about other things, but you can try letting your wife, your mom and your son touch your cell phone. Nothing will happen. I won&#39;t lose my temper or show anger in my face. However, after going into my room, I&#39;ll wipe it with a wet tissue. - That&#39;s okay. / - That&#39;s all right. Instead of losing your temper in front of them, - you&#39;ll accept it. / - You&#39;ll gladly go in. Sure, I can do that. Why don&#39;t you let your wife touch your cell phone? - Do you have it? / - Pass it to your wife. - Hold on. / - Hold on. - He passed it so easily. / - She looks so happy. - Hold on. / - Hold on. - He passed it so easily. / - She looks so happy. It seems as if she&#39;s getting a diamond ring. - Look at her face. / - She looks so happy. - She looks excited. / - She does, right? Have you never touched your husband&#39;s cell phone? - I haven&#39;t. / - You haven&#39;t. Sir, say, &quot;I love you&quot; and pass your cell phone. Say &quot;I love you&quot; and pass your cell phone. - I love you. / - My gosh. Be gentle! - Touch as much as you want. / - His hand seems very uncomfortable. - He wants it back soon. / - That&#39;s right. Try not to wipe it today. (Just thinking about it makes me feel uncomfortable.) Nothing will happen even if you don&#39;t wipe it. - That&#39;s right. / - You need to endure this stage in order to overcome yourself. In fact, when I was in my early 30s, I had a phobia of all kinds of living things beside human. I hated myself back then, so I decided to start doing what I hated most. I adopted a dog. - It&#39;s true. / - You adopted a dog on purpose. At first, I trembled when I touched the dog, but with time, I couldn&#39;t live without him. You need to consider if you aren&#39;t confined to your own space. - You may be deceiving yourself. / - That&#39;s right. What do you want to do with your son? He&#39;s a man of few words. - You want to talk. / - Yes, I want to talk a lot. What do you want to do with your husband? I want to have a lot of conversation with him. You want to have a lot of conversation. What else? Youngchul wants to see more of his dad. - His son misses him? / - I also miss him. You want to spend time together with your son. From now on, I will try to make time to speak with my wife and my mother. It&#39;s been six years since your wife came to Korea. In six years, others can master Korean. - We didn&#39;t talk a lot. / - Your wife isn&#39;t fluent - due to lack of conversations. / - That&#39;s it. She can learn from the conversations. That&#39;s right. Let&#39;s begin with Ho Ran. He&#39;s having a hard time and wants to change. He hates himself for how he is. I think he gave an honest answer. He&#39;s aware of that fact and is willing to change. I really wish he could be happy. I want to say I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a worry. We&#39;ll skip Alex. (He&#39;s obviously on the son&#39;s side.) Is it a worry or not? - I think it&#39;s a worry. / - Right. When I heard the story, I thought he couldn&#39;t change on his own. He needs to see a doctor who understands him. He also needs the proper medication. I think that&#39;s where he should start. I think it&#39;s a worry. You think it&#39;s a worry for his mother. She didn&#39;t come on the show because her son&#39;s obsession bothers her. - She wants her son to be happy, / - That&#39;s right. and she sees him struggling alone. That&#39;s what breaks her heart. Press the button if you think it&#39;s a worry. (What does the audience think?) - In five, four, / - In five, four, - three, two, one. / - three, two, one. - Time&#39;s up. / - Time&#39;s up. Do you have any last words for Mom? Mo... Mo... Mom. I... He&#39;s not used to talking to her. He even stutters when he calls her. You have to start talking to her. Conversation is the key. It sure is. I did many things to hurt your feelings. I never expressed my feelings, but I&#39;ve always felt sorry. Now that I know how you feel, I&#39;ll try not to lose my temper with the family and become a changed man. I&#39;ll receive medical treatment if I have to. - He&#39;s willing to change. / - I&#39;ll try to change. - Say something to your wife, too. / - That&#39;s right. She&#39;s always lonely. Yeongja, you were right on point back there. I&#39;m not your wife. Tell Yunah that. Tell her how much you love her. Okay. - Start with her name. / - Call her name. Yu... Yu... Yunah. He&#39;s shy. - He&#39;s embarrassed. / - Look how shy he is. - Take your time. / - Look how happy Yunah is. - Pretend you&#39;re at home. / - This is how I think. - Tell her that. / - Tell Yunah that. (You have to talk to your wife.) Yunah, I&#39;m an old man. I&#39;m really grateful that you are my wife. I&#39;m not good with expressing my feelings. After I married you, I passed the exam and got a son. It&#39;s all thanks to you. Tell her how much you love her. From now on, I&#39;ll try to express my love. - Give her a hug. / - I&#39;m sorry about what I&#39;ve done. Give her a hug. Give her a hug once. - I love you. / - He loves her. (I love you, Honey.) Tell her she can use your phone any time she wants. Tell her you won&#39;t say anything about that. You have to take things slow. Don&#39;t rush him. He&#39;s taking it out. - Give it to her. / - Why are you hesitating? Yunah. (This is my love confession.) (I&#39;ll leave this in your hands from now on.) Look at his hands. Look where his hands are after he gave her the phone. Take his hand, Yunah. - Take his hand. / - Come on. - There you go. / - That&#39;s good. It doesn&#39;t matter how many votes they got. - That&#39;s right. / - Yes. I really wish - you could live happily starting from today. / - Yes. Show us the result. (The result) (&quot;He&#39;ll Explode If I Touch It.&quot;) Is it over 100? It is. (It took courage for him to be willing to change.) (Will he be the winner?) What did he get? - He got 101 votes. / - It&#39;s 101. (Survived) (Eliminated) - You can go sit next to your son. / - Thank you. Thanks for your courage. Keep holding hands. (We wish you a happy life.) The next one is called, &quot;He&#39;s Too Much.&quot; This is the next worry. I have a husband who is seven years younger than me. People always tell me this. &quot;Good for you. I&#39;m so jealous.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s it like to live with a younger husband?&quot; What&#39;s it like? You should see the things he does. He&#39;s driving me crazy. Every night, - he sneaks out of the house. / - What? &quot;Where are you going this time?&quot; &quot;Are you cheating on me?&quot; &quot;What are you talking about? I have to go.&quot; He was acting suspicious, so I decided to follow him. This is interesting. He went in the bathroom of a shopping center. (He&#39;s moaning.) (What&#39;s that sound?) (He&#39;s moaning.) There were his clothes hanging on the door. (Her husband&#39;s clothes were lying around.) What? (He&#39;s knocking.) &quot;What are you doing in there?&quot; &quot;What are you doing here? Stop knocking.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m taking a poop.&quot; Every night, my husband goes to a public toilet. (Her husband goes to a public toilet to poop.) The funny thing is he looks for the toilet he has to squat on. Oh, the old kind. &quot;It&#39;s an hour after midnight. Why are you so late?&quot; &quot;I couldn&#39;t find the toilet I was looking for.&quot; &quot;I had to go near the house we lived in before.&quot; I tried hard to understand him, but I just can&#39;t. Why is he like this? He can&#39;t actually be cheating on me, can he? (What&#39;s the real reason you&#39;re out every night?) She&#39;s worried about her husband&#39;s bowel movement. The funny thing is he can&#39;t poop without a specific kind of toilet. - That&#39;s the thing, right? / - Yes, it is. - That&#39;s the toilet. / - Right. It was invented in Netherlands. - Oh, so that&#39;s where the name came from. / - Yes. Yes, apparently. - It sounds like a worry. / - Right? She can&#39;t follow him every night he sneaks out. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s hard not to get suspicious. Let&#39;s meet the wife of the husband who goes out on a search for squat toilets every night. Come on out. (Today&#39;s guest&#39;s husband sneaks out every night.) (Heo Eunok) We had a guest a while back who didn&#39;t let her husband poop at home. - I remember that. / - This is the opposite case. - That&#39;s right. / - Have you seen the episode? My husband is way more serious. He only goes while squatting. There&#39;s a public toilet close to home, but he takes buses to go elsewhere. He makes a 20-minute-long trip to go to a toilet. - He walks there. / - What? - He goes by foot. / - What if he&#39;s in a hurry? - If he gets the signal, / - Does he get ready? he just starts walking there. There must be a reason. What is it? He likes squatting in general. - Does he stay like that at home? / - Yes. - He stays like this at home? / - That&#39;s odd. - Yes. / - It&#39;s not easy to stay like that. - What? / - When does he sit like that? - Even when we eat, / - Really? we would be sitting by the table - Does he sit on the chair like that? / - Yes. - Like this? / - Yes. Did you really follow him? He always sneaks out at night. It was after our first baby, and I got suspicious. I followed him. He kept going to areas of motels. (Her husband kept going near motels.) - Oh, my. / - Are you serious? That&#39;s where his toilet was. - My heart was pounding. / - What happened next? I didn&#39;t know what to do. He went in the public toilet near the motels. When I went inside, his clothes were hanging on the door. Did he take his clothes off? I could see his clothes. - There were his pants and his shirt. / - The pants... - Wait, he took off his shirt? / - Yes. - His shirt? / - Was he naked? - Did he go to the toilet naked? / - I see. It got me thinking. He must be up to something. Things that Dongyeop is thinking of right now? Yes, probably. - I see. / - I kept knocking on the door. I told him to open the door. He said he&#39;s taking care of his business. He must have been startled. - You&#39;re right. / - Sure. Your wife is the last person you would expect. The public toilet was even near motels. I had no idea that was what he&#39;d been doing. I couldn&#39;t believe it. You should have run away with his pants. (You should have run away with his pants.) You could just think that he has a weird habit. - He gets off work late. / - Right. When he comes back home, he gets changed and goes out again. I don&#39;t see him a lot. The kids wait for him all day. They want to play with him, but he just leaves. How long is he out usually? For more than an hour. - It takes time to get there and back. / - 40 minutes. It takes about an hour or two. It&#39;s hard for me to understand. When you&#39;re squatting, it usually comes right out. That&#39;s how it usually is. That&#39;s what happens to me. - It does make it a lot quicker. / - It does. If you sit on that toilet for a long time, you&#39;ll die. You&#39;ll need to hold onto something to get up. - That&#39;s right. / - You might not be able to get up. - Yes. / - Your legs will be numb. (You won&#39;t be able to get up alone.) You&#39;ll have to get up like this. - Seriously. / - It could get serious. Let&#39;s meet her husband and find out why he does it. Where are you, Sir? (Who&#39;s her husband?) Nice to meet you. Do you really never use the toilet at your place? - Do you only use squat toilets? / - Yes. Why? Why do you do that? It&#39;s more comfortable. Isn&#39;t the posture uncomfortable? No, it&#39;s very comfortable. - Really? / - Yes. We heard you sit at home like that, too. You find it comfortable? Some people sit like this when they&#39;re cold. - My gosh. / - It suits you. - I sit like this. / - He&#39;s so flexible. It&#39;s been a habit since I was a kid. How can he put his legs up like that? I sit like that at home whether I&#39;m eating or watching TV. I find it so comfortable. Most people find that very uncomfortable, though. Compared to sitting with legs crossed... - Is it more comfortable for you? / - Yes. - Can you do it again for us? / - No, I don&#39;t want to. He said he doesn&#39;t want to. My goodness. I must say, he&#39;s very charming. When you sit like this, your bottoms touch the floor, so I guess it wouldn&#39;t be too uncomfortable. But when you&#39;re using the toilet... I do the same thing when I&#39;m sitting at home. - My butt is... / - Do you do this? - Do you shift your body weight like this? / - Yes. - Is that possible? / - Don&#39;t your legs hurt? Not as much as when I sit with my legs crossed. Then for how long can you sit like that? I can sit like that through a whole movie. You can hold that position throughout a movie? - Yes. / - Your knees must hurt. Where&#39;s the hottest squat toilet at the moment? Which neighborhood is it? Where&#39;s the bathroom you use most often these days? Do I have to tell you? (Do I have to tell you?) You can tell Yeongja. - No, no. / - When did you start hating me? No, no. I don&#39;t hate you. He probably doesn&#39;t want other people to know. What do you like about that bathroom? It&#39;s very comfortable and neat. It&#39;s clean, too. It&#39;s been selected by the city as... - As a clean public bathroom, right? / - But, why do you take off your clothes? I always eliminate my bowels before I take a shower. That&#39;s what I do at home, so it&#39;s become a habit. Having clothes on my body feels uncomfortable. Do you use the toilet at home? - A long time ago. / - I see, a long time ago. - You must&#39;ve had a squat toilet at home. / - Probably. Yes. I grew up in a small rural town. So it&#39;s something you&#39;re used to since as a kid. - It&#39;s a habit. / - Yes. It&#39;s my habit. Your wife was suspicious of you and followed you. - Yes. / - What&#39;s your thought on that? I think it could look suspicious to anyone. I don&#39;t get it. (I don&#39;t get it.) But you take one to two hours. Do you only use a bathroom, or do you also go to a convenience store for a beer? Do you do it because you need some time alone? I do ponder and smoke a cigarette on my way. - There&#39;s a little bit of that. / - I see. - A bit of everything. / - Your kids wait for you. Don&#39;t you ever think about that? I do make sure to spend time with them. - When? / - On the weekends. Cigarettes taste better when you&#39;re squatting down. That&#39;s right. (We do understand you, Sir.) - That&#39;s so right. / - Don&#39;t you agree? How many cigarettes do you smoke sitting like that? About three to four. - I see. / - Really? Then has he never used your toilet at home? He has. - He has. / - Yes. I guess he really had to go. He ran in and didn&#39;t lock the door. I didn&#39;t know he was in there - Did you open the door? / - and opened the door. He was squatting down on top of the toilet. - So... / - Seriously? (How embarrassing.) Then our eyes met, and he got so angry at me. You two must&#39;ve had the same eye level. He has a temper. Having someone walk in when you&#39;re like this is very different from when you&#39;re sitting like this. You&#39;d feel mortified. He thought he closed the door. That day, I was trying to sleep at night, - and I was... / - It must&#39;ve been a shock. I thought, &quot;Does he have a problem?&quot; That was shortly after we got married. I kept thinking, &quot;Is he a weirdo?&quot; I couldn&#39;t sleep well that night. - Because of it? / - Yes. He didn&#39;t have clothes on, either. - Think about it, guys. / - He was naked, too. Why did you use the toilet at home that day? - You said you never use it. / - Exactly. Those urgent situations happen occasionally. Yes. Everyone gets urgent urges at times. What do you think about getting a squat toilet? - Even if we have one at home, / - Will he go out? I think he&#39;ll still go out. - Really? / - I think it&#39;s just an excuse. - Why do you say that? / - I had a C-section when I was giving birth to my first kid. I asked him for help when I had to bathe my baby, but he just left saying that he had to go. When I was pregnant, I told him I was craving dakbal. I asked him to go pick up dakbal, but he just left because he had to use a bathroom. - He does that too often. / - He&#39;s using it as - a handy excuse. / - Because he does things like that, I can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s only an excuse. He&#39;s using it as an excuse to get out of the house. That&#39;s what I think. What do you think of what your wife just said? It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s true. - He&#39;s so calm. / - &quot;Then what&#39;s the truth?&quot; &quot;Tell us.&quot; He&#39;s so calm. Kids usually can&#39;t lie. They say what they see. Does your dad go out to use a bathroom every day? Sometimes he doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s only once in a while, though. Sometimes he doesn&#39;t go. - He goes almost every day? / - Once a year. (He stays home once a year.) Once a year. That means he goes out every day. Besides his habit, does he have any other obsessions? - He cares a lot about his hair. / - His hair? - He has his own hairstyle, / - I see. and it has to stay intact once he styles his hair. He doesn&#39;t like it when anyone touches his hair. It&#39;s his style, so I get that. - Even when our kids end up / - They can touch it. touching it while they&#39;re playing, he gets angry. &quot;You ruined Daddy&#39;s hair.&quot; Does he say that? - Yes, he does. / - He gets really angry. You should let your family know about your wig now. (It&#39;s time to reveal your secret.) There&#39;s also an angle he prefers when he sleeps. There&#39;s a specific angle he prefers, and it has to be maintained. What do you mean? I don&#39;t really understand it. Is it the bed itself or... It&#39;s his posture. I see, his posture. - When he&#39;s lying down? / - Yes. Once he gets in that angle he likes, even if I ask him for help when I desperately need it, - He doesn&#39;t get up? / - he doesn&#39;t move because he doesn&#39;t want to ruin that perfect angle. - So he doesn&#39;t get up once he lies down. / - Right. - I get so upset. / - He has some great excuses. Does it feel weird when that angle is ruined? Yes, it&#39;s uncomfortable. You can&#39;t be accurate, though. &quot;37cm on the left and 41cm on the right.&quot; You can&#39;t do that. I&#39;m so curious. Can you show us here? I probably can&#39;t because there&#39;s no blanket. You need a blanket to achieve that perfect angle. Do you put your blanket between your legs? Yes. With my legs, I do Gosh, it&#39;s difficult to explain. I put my leg up like this and cover it in my blanket. My toes have to come out a little bit. It&#39;s something like that. (Gosh, we&#39;re speechless.) There&#39;s a specific posture he finds comfortable. I can&#39;t even touch him. - Seriously? / - Yes. - I guess it wakes him up. / - Yes. I can tell how upset the wife is. She also resents him. Her husband, on the other hand... - He&#39;s so calm. / - &quot;Why is this a problem?&quot; I don&#39;t think you understand why she&#39;s upset. No, I don&#39;t really understand her. (No, I don&#39;t really understand her.) I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t all. She must&#39;ve reached out to us because there are other things, too. When did he upset you the most? I became depressed because of various reasons and suffered from serious depression. Once, I told him that I think my condition is serious. &quot;Only those who have nothing to do get depressed.&quot; (Only those who have nothing to do get depressed.) That&#39;s what he said. He didn&#39;t take it seriously. No. He said, &quot;It&#39;s because you&#39;re not working.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re depressed. Don&#39;t even bring it up.&quot; - He thought you were spoiled. / - Exactly. Why did you say that, Sir? I think that people get depressed when they keep thinking about things nonstop. In my opinion, that&#39;s how depression starts. If she&#39;s really busy with looking after our kids or housework, she&#39;ll be more productive and... What prompted you to have depressive thoughts? I... I actually had a fracture on my spine. (She had a fracture on her spine.) I was hospitalized for a few months because of it. - Was it after you gave birth? / - Yes. - How did it happen? / - Also, I had a miscarriage when I was pregnant with my third baby. I needed surgery, so I was hospitalized. But he said, &quot;You have such a comfortable life.&quot; - Goodness. / - When I had a fracture on my spine, - I was hospitalized for a few months. / - Right. He came and said, &quot;You&#39;re glowing.&quot; &quot;You must be so comfortable.&quot; That upset me a lot because I was in so much pain. I think that&#39;s how he talks. - How can you say that, Sir? / - He says... No, she misunderstood me. I said it as a joke. That&#39;s what everyone is saying today. (That&#39;s what all husbands say.) She used to look tired from all the housework she does, but she started to glow after a month at the hospital. - She looked pretty. / - I see. So I just said it as a joke. - Because she looked pretty? / - Yes. I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d hurt her feelings. - Then you should&#39;ve said... / - He did this. Why are you being mean to me? What did he say? As soon as he arrived, he poked my face like this and said, &quot;Look at your face. It&#39;s shiny.&quot; Why are you doing it to me, though? You&#39;re saying that you said it as a compliment, - but it really hurt her feelings. / - When I said it, - I said something else. / - What did you say? Dongyeop is good at saying things like that. What is it? (Dongyeop is shy.) - What is it? / - What did you say? I told her that we should have another baby. I thought she looked so pretty that day. What&#39;s important is the fact that your wife was - hospitalized because of her spine. / - Right now... You should&#39;ve said, &quot;Honey, are you feeling better?&quot; Jokes could have waited. &quot;Honey, I&#39;m sorry to say this right now,&quot; - &quot;but you look so pretty today.&quot; / - &quot;You look good.&quot; - Exactly. / - Then it would&#39;ve been okay. - I totally agree. / - But what you did is wrong. - That&#39;s why she got upset. / - Did those things - make you become depressed / - Yes. and pessimistic about things? In addition, our kids want to spend time with him, but he comes home very late. - About what time? / - After midnight. That&#39;s when he comes home from work? - Is that after he uses a bathroom? / - It must be. - Does he go out again? / - He does. That&#39;s why I get upset. When I had cravings during my pregnancy, he never went out to buy the food. - But he goes out for his needs. / - Yes. &quot;Why do you want to eat at this hour?&quot; - He was like that, / - He&#39;s selfish. but he goes out late at night for his needs. You also think that you were too cold to her, right? You made her feel lonely. Yes. I do feel bad about it. When she was pregnant with our second kid, I did everything she asked me to. Why are you laughing? He hasn&#39;t done anything for me, yet he talks as if he&#39;s been so good to me. (He&#39;s all talk.) (That summed it up nicely.) Does your husband always talk like that? I must say that he sounds a little robotic. He looks emotionless. He&#39;s like this. &quot;Yes. Right.&quot; (No matter how upset his wife is,) (he looks so calm and unsympathetic.) - He&#39;s so calm. / - Does he ever get excited? When does he get excited? - Never? / - He never gets excited? - He&#39;s probably exhausted. / - He&#39;s always like that. He could go wild and run around when he&#39;s not home. Right, on his way to the bathroom. He could get excited in the bathroom. (I can see the bathroom.) No, he&#39;d get excited while running. (I&#39;m so excited.) When you&#39;re trying to talk to him, if he keeps being calm like this, doesn&#39;t it drive you crazy? - How do you feel? / - If he&#39;s unhappy about something, - Does he get angry? / - he loses his temper. - He yells... / - What we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t everything. He&#39;s not expressive when he&#39;s happy, - but when he&#39;s angry... / - He&#39;s extreme. He gets worked up and loses his temper easily. - Does it scare you at times? / - Yes. Sir. Frankly, I can&#39;t quite comprehend it. I&#39;m assuming going out like that de-stresses you. Are there things that are stressing you out to make you have to do that? My job is very stressful. I manage commercial clients. I&#39;m the middleman, though. Both my clients and the subcontractors press me. On busy days, I make 100 phone calls. - When I get home, I have no energy left. / - Right. So I step out to clear my head and have a smoke. You probably don&#39;t want to talk to anyone. You must really need those 1 to 2 hours of alone time. Yes. Usually, I only get to come home early on one or two days during the week. That&#39;s why having that time is crucial for me, - but it hurts her feelings. / - Right. I do hope that you can understand how stressed out your husband is. How would you like your husband to change? Whenever I want to do something with him, he says - that he has to go to the bathroom. / - That&#39;s crazy. - It probably discourages you. / - Exactly. It&#39;d drive me crazy, too. He has armed himself with the most powerful weapon. What can she say about him going to the bathroom? Going out to use a bathroom is fine. I get that he needs to do it, but he takes - He takes too long. / - way too long, which takes time away from things we can do together. It&#39;s a vicious cycle. We always end up fighting because of that one issue. Please tell him specifically. Don&#39;t get angry at us. If you have to go use a bathroom while playing with the kids, don&#39;t get angry at them. - Please don&#39;t do that, Sir. / - I hope you can show them you genuinely care about them. - I think... / - Don&#39;t get angry when you step out. - I won&#39;t. / - &quot;I need to use the toilet.&quot; (Daddy needs to run to the toilet.) &quot;Daddy will be right back, kids.&quot; He should pick up dakbal on his way back. - That&#39;s right. / - Pick up delicious food. - He should be more mindful. / - Yes. Come home before your kids go to bed. You haven&#39;t said much. - I know. / - Yes. - I definitely think it&#39;s a worry. / - I see. I hope that the two of you can work it out and try to create a happier environment - for your kids. / - Right. I saw something online. It&#39;s a product made for people who can only use squat toilets. It can be installed on regular toilets. - There&#39;s such a thing? / - It&#39;s like a footrest. It allows you to get in that position. - You should try it. / - They both need to work on it. I want to say that it&#39;s not a worry. It&#39;s hopeful. I think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. There must be a lot of other issues underneath it, but they&#39;re not aware of it. That&#39;s a bigger problem. Hence, I do think it&#39;s a worry. Press the button if you empathize with the worry. (What does the audience think?) - In five, four, / - In five, four, - three, two, one. / - three, two, one. - Time is up. / - Stop. - Sir, please say a few words to your wife. / - Sure. We&#39;ve been together for over 11 years, but I still remember the moment I first met you. I love you. Our family is the only thing in my mind, and I&#39;m doing my best to work hard, so don&#39;t worry too much. (Don&#39;t worry too much.) I just want you to know this. My love for you hasn&#39;t changed at all. Then you should express it more. - I love you. / - She can&#39;t read your mind. (Thank you, and I love you.) How many votes did &quot;He&#39;s Too Much&quot; get? Show us. (The result) Will it be able to beat the winner? (&quot;He&#39;s Too Much&quot;) If it gets 169 votes, it&#39;ll become the new winner. (Will it get 169 votes and take its first win?) If it gets 169 votes, it&#39;ll become the new winner. I see. It got 119 votes. Thank you. We hope you can resolve it soon. This means &quot;Why Are You with Me?&quot; takes its second win today. You&#39;ll get a gift certificate. Congratulations. Until the day we are all worry-free... Hello Counselor will continue to counsel you. - Thank you. / - Thank you. (&quot;I Wonder&quot; by Clazziquai)
