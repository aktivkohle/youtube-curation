the getting to know your class segment with</text><text start="73.47" dur="15.91">DannielleRae.</text><text start="89.38" dur="18.53">Hi!I&amp;#39;m DannielleRae with the Crafting Club
Updates.</text><text start="107.91" dur="4.29">Current theme of the month is dream pillows
and sachets, and I have personally experimented</text><text start="112.2" dur="2.52">with
a couple different dried herbs and aromatics</text><text start="114.72" dur="3.31">with some success, and some failure.</text><text start="118.03" dur="2.52">Kind of
amazing how the energies can be compatible,</text><text start="120.55" dur="2.71">but the scents don&amp;#39;t blend the way you think
they</text><text start="123.26" dur="1">should.</text><text start="124.26" dur="3.13">Our upcoming theme of the month is staffs
and wands...</text><text start="127.39" dur="5.49">This is a tool that you can choose already
found and made all yours by personalization</text><text start="132.88" dur="4.81">and consecration, or you can start from scratch
finding the raw materials yourself.</text><text start="137.69" dur="2.909">While using wood is the most common start
for crafting either</text><text start="140.599" dur="4.28">the staff or wand, you may choose a material
that calls to you.</text><text start="144.879" dur="5.791">I&amp;#39;ve seen blown glass, beaded
creations, even assembled and wired gemstones</text><text start="150.67" dur="1.85">that can serve as wands.</text><text start="152.52" dur="4.9">The more traditional route is to opt for a
branch from a chosen tree, bush, or even matured</text><text start="157.42" dur="1">herb
plant.</text><text start="158.42" dur="5.429">The kind of source that you pick can be completely
random, as in a fallen limb from a tree</text><text start="163.849" dur="3.711">that you find during a walk through the woods,
or this can be a very deliberate choice made</text><text start="167.56" dur="3.9">specifically for the energies of a host tree.</text><text start="171.46" dur="2.26">Research some tree associations to find something
that</text><text start="173.72" dur="3.91">is in line with your purposes, or the kind
of magick that you are attracted to.</text><text start="177.63" dur="6.65">There are some different schools of thought
on how to obtain the perfect piece to craft</text><text start="184.28" dur="1.5">a wand or
staff.</text><text start="185.78" dur="6.4">You can pick the part of a living tree or
bush and communicate your intent and your</text><text start="192.18" dur="2.55">thanks
for the gift that you will cut from the tree.</text><text start="194.73" dur="2.8">If you go this route, be sure you research
the best time</text><text start="197.53" dur="4.89">and way to harvest your branch so that you
will inflict less damage to the host.</text><text start="202.42" dur="2.68">However, other
practitioners believe that this is never a</text><text start="205.1" dur="2.75">good thing to do, and you simply must wait
for the gift.</text><text start="207.85" dur="5.53">The choice that you make leads you into the
next basic step of how to craft the wand or</text><text start="213.38" dur="1">staff.</text><text start="214.38" dur="1">Will
you strip the bark?</text><text start="215.38" dur="2.3">Carve symbols or words into the wood?</text><text start="217.68" dur="2.96">But, is that the next step for you?</text><text start="220.64" dur="2.94">When do you attune the wand or staff?</text><text start="223.58" dur="3.22">Is this before or during the crafting process?</text><text start="226.8" dur="2.88">Is this
something that you do after you have personalized</text><text start="229.68" dur="3.61">it and have had a chance to experience the
energy that resides within?</text><text start="233.29" dur="4.8">This is the journey of witch crafting...and
we want to discuss this process with you.</text><text start="238.09" dur="4.51">Come and
share your experiences, or maybe you will</text><text start="242.6" dur="3.84">get inspired to try to craft your own wand
or staff.</text><text start="246.44" dur="14.31">Join the </text><text start="260.75" dur="5.02">Crafting Club and get involved with like-minded
crafters.</text><text start="265.77" dur="25.35">Who knows what you&amp;#39;ll be
inspired to try.</text><text start="291.12" dur="12.68">HI, I am DannielleRae!</text><text start="303.8" dur="8.57">Welcome to the Kitchen Witch Club updates.</text><text start="312.37" dur="4.76">This month in the Plant of the Month series,
we will discuss harvesting apples, and sowing</text><text start="317.13" dur="1.81">spring
cabbages.</text><text start="318.94" dur="4.259">The apple is such a versatile fruit, that
it can be considered the white candle of magick.</text><text start="323.199" dur="4.581">Every part
of the apple can be used, and the apple tree</text><text start="327.78" dur="2.53">itself produces usable magickal tools throughout
the</text><text start="330.31" dur="1">year.</text><text start="331.31" dur="4.13">For instance, The leaves of an apple tree
can be harvested at anytime, and dried like</text><text start="335.44" dur="1.97">any other
herb.</text><text start="337.41" dur="4.43">Apple blossoms are a five petaled bud that
reveals a striking flower, usually pink on</text><text start="341.84" dur="2.34">the
outside and white on the inside.</text><text start="344.18" dur="4.72">These are harvested in the spring time and
can be dried and stored</text><text start="348.9" dur="5.28">for spellwork, spiritual offerings, or can
be used in teas and other edible recipes.</text><text start="354.18" dur="2.45">When apple
blossoms are fertilized either by itself,</text><text start="356.63" dur="3.56">as in self-pollinating varieties or the pollen
of another</text><text start="360.19" dur="5.34">companion tree, the base of the bottom actually
grows to become the fruit.</text><text start="365.53" dur="6.37">There are four basic groups of cultivars:
Early flowering, midseason flowering, late-season</text><text start="371.9" dur="1.42">flowering and very-late-season flowering.</text><text start="373.32" dur="3.8">Here in the United States, there are more
than 100</text><text start="377.12" dur="4.09">different varieties that are grown commercially,
so our supermarket and produce stands seem</text><text start="381.21" dur="2.64">to
always have some sort of apples available,</text><text start="383.85" dur="2.2">no matter the time of the year.</text><text start="386.05" dur="4.3">Worldwide there are
more than 7500 varieties of apples, so chances</text><text start="390.35" dur="2.73">are, no matter where in the world you are,
there is</text><text start="393.08" dur="1.26">an apple available!</text><text start="394.34" dur="4.49">The most popular varieties include Red Delicious,
Golden Delicious, Granny</text><text start="398.83" dur="8.7">Smith, McIntosh, Rome Beauty, Fuji, Jonathan,
York, Gala, Idared, and Yellow Newton.</text><text start="407.53" dur="4.43">Apple trees can grow from 10 to 30 feet tall,
and can easily be as wide.</text><text start="411.96" dur="2.799">The tree itself may live for
more than 100 years.</text><text start="414.759" dur="3.021">The older the tree the longer it takes the
fruit to mature.</text><text start="417.78" dur="3.12">It can take several
years for a new apple tree to bear fruit that</text><text start="420.9" dur="2.69">is acceptable – anywhere from 3-6 years
depending on</text><text start="423.59" dur="1.12">the variety.</text><text start="424.71" dur="4.14">It can take 100 to 200 days for the fruit
to mature enough for harvest.</text><text start="428.85" dur="2.83">It can be
difficult to gauge the maturity from skin</text><text start="431.68" dur="1">color alone.</text><text start="432.68" dur="4.269">A mature apple is easily picked from the tree
and won&amp;#39;t require being cut from it.</text><text start="436.949" dur="4.511">However, the best test is to taste the apple.</text><text start="441.46" dur="3.56">This will reveal if
the apple is sour, or starchy.</text><text start="445.02" dur="4.22">The apples should be firm and crisp, but the
flavor needs to be right.</text><text start="449.24" dur="3.01">Once picked, the apples need to be sorted.</text><text start="452.25" dur="2.169">The ones with damage or blights need to be
used or</text><text start="454.419" dur="1.391">tossed right away.</text><text start="455.81" dur="5.02">The saying that, “one bad apple spoils the
whole barrel” has merits.</text><text start="460.83" dur="2.369">If one bad
apple is stored with the good ones, soon the</text><text start="463.199" dur="1.31">whole bunch of them will turn bad.</text><text start="464.509" dur="2.541">This is actually
based on the production of ethylene gases,</text><text start="467.05" dur="2">but we don&amp;#39;t have to get that scientific.</text><text start="469.05" dur="4.01">Simply, store
your apples in a cool dry place, sorted by</text><text start="473.06" dur="1">size.</text><text start="474.06" dur="2.13">Use larger apples first, since the smaller
will keep</text><text start="476.19" dur="1.46">fresh for longer.</text><text start="477.65" dur="4.8">The apples with the stems intact will also
store longer.</text><text start="482.45" dur="3.85">Apples are so treasured that many cultures
have history of giving offerings to the trees</text><text start="486.3" dur="2.089">themselves,
in hopes that they would have an abundant</text><text start="488.389" dur="2.161">harvest in the next year.</text><text start="490.55" dur="4.5">Pouring apple cider or juice
on the ground of the tree or in any of your</text><text start="495.05" dur="4.54">garden areas is done to promote the fertility
of the soil.</text><text start="499.59" dur="4.33">Apples are often used in spellwork, because
the apple itself, when cut width-wise reveals</text><text start="503.92" dur="2.529">a 5-
pointed star.</text><text start="506.449" dur="5.601">Basic Information and Aspects for apples include
Common Folk Names: such as Fruit of the Gods,</text><text start="512.05" dur="2.26">Fruit of the Uderworld, Silver Branch, The
Silver</text><text start="514.31" dur="2.55">Bough, and Tree of Love
Gender: is Feminine</text><text start="516.86" dur="3.159">Planet: is Venus
Element: is Water</text><text start="520.019" dur="5.611">Powers: are for Love, Healing, Garden Magic,
and Immortality</text><text start="525.63" dur="4.019">Magickal Uses: eat the apple for wisdom, knowledge
and good health.</text><text start="529.649" dur="4.091">Share eating the apple with
one that you love or in other love spells.</text><text start="533.74" dur="3.459">Cut the apple, rub the pieces on your body
and bury them</text><text start="537.199" dur="3.361">for localized healing.</text><text start="540.56" dur="3.99">After a storm, gather branches from apple
trees to use for wands or wreaths</text><text start="544.55" dur="9.49">to promote emotional magick and the element
of water.</text><text start="554.04" dur="4.5">Spring Cabbage– Sow
To go along with our apples, we have spring</text><text start="558.54" dur="2.58">cabbages to sow for the upcoming colder months.</text><text start="561.12" dur="5.11">Believe it or not, I was a bit skeptical on
if the harvesting chart was correct.</text><text start="566.23" dur="1.98">Spring cabbages in
this time of the year?</text><text start="568.21" dur="1.14">Didn&amp;#39;t make sense.</text><text start="569.35" dur="2.42">After a lot of research, there is a huge amount
of varieties</text><text start="571.77" dur="4.89">available when it comes to cabbages, and you
can actually have them all year round as long</text><text start="576.66" dur="1.48">as you
plan!</text><text start="578.14" dur="3.78">So &amp;#39;spring cabbage&amp;#39; may not necessarily be
the type you will be sowing this month.</text><text start="581.92" dur="4.7">I&amp;#39;ll start with the different varieties encase
you still need to choose them.</text><text start="586.62" dur="7.37">Spring Cabbages: April; Durham Early; Greensleeves;
January King; Offenham 1-Myatt&amp;#39;s;</text><text start="593.99" dur="3.63">Offenham Compacta; Pixie; and Spring Hero.</text><text start="597.62" dur="7.35">Summer Cabbages: Castello; Derby Day; Hispi;
Minicole; Primo; and Quickstep.</text><text start="604.97" dur="6.79">Autumn Cabbages: Autoro; Bingo; Castello;
Minnicole; Rapier and Winnigstadt.</text><text start="611.76" dur="8.78">Winter Cabbages and Savoys: Best of All; Capriccio;
Celtic; Christmas; Drumhead; Duncan;</text><text start="620.54" dur="10.48">Hidena; Ice Queen; January King; Novusa; Ormskirk
Late; Tundra; and Wivoy.</text><text start="631.02" dur="7.22">Red Cabbages include: Kissendrup; Metro; Red
Drumhead; Red Dutch; Ruby Ball; and Vesta.</text><text start="638.24" dur="5.53">So, sowing time for &amp;#39;spring&amp;#39; cabbage is actually
late summer, so perfect to sow now or even</text><text start="643.77" dur="1">in the
next month.</text><text start="644.77" dur="5.4">Sow them about 1 cm/ 1⁄2 inch down in the
earth, with the distance between rows 15</text><text start="650.17" dur="7.66">cm/ 6 inches and then plant the seeds 30-38
cm/ 12-15 inches apart.</text><text start="657.83" dur="3.61">Basically just give them
enough room to grow!</text><text start="661.44" dur="2.821">These cabbages will be harvested in the spring.</text><text start="664.261" dur="4.669">They do their best growing in open sunny places,
in soils that are fertile and reasonably free</text><text start="668.93" dur="1">for</text><text start="669.93" dur="1">draining.</text><text start="670.93" dur="4.24">If you&amp;#39;re growing them inside first, then
give them about 4-5 weeks until they have</text><text start="675.17" dur="1">about</text><text start="676.17" dur="3.64">four or five leaves and then move them to
their final resting place.</text><text start="679.81" dur="1.36">Make sure you firm the soil</text><text start="681.17" dur="3.02">around the roots once you&amp;#39;ve moved them, this
can be done using a trowel though I&amp;#39;m sure</text><text start="684.19" dur="1">patting</text><text start="685.19" dur="1.17">it with your hands works just as well!</text><text start="686.36" dur="2.59">Water them well and keep watering until they
have become</text><text start="688.95" dur="1">established.</text><text start="689.95" dur="2.68">Don&amp;#39;t forget to hoe regularly and keep the
weeds away.</text><text start="692.63" dur="1.55">Draw up the soil around the</text><text start="694.18" dur="3.99">stems for overwintering varieties and remove
any dead leaves.</text><text start="698.17" dur="3.74">There are some pests and diseases to look
out for.</text><text start="701.91" dur="2.1">Mainly cabbage root fly, but these can be
taken</text><text start="704.01" dur="4.24">care of by protecting the roots and stems
of the cabbage with a collar.</text><text start="708.25" dur="1">The collar can be made of</text><text start="709.25" dur="4.26">roof felt or similar materials.</text><text start="713.51" dur="2.58">This prevents the flies from laying their
eggs.</text><text start="716.09" dur="1.369">Keep and eye out for</text><text start="717.459" dur="1.521">caterpillars, and flea beetles.</text><text start="718.98" dur="3.02">Also slugs and snails need to be kept an eye
on.</text><text start="722" dur="1">However, the worst</text><text start="723" dur="3.769">thing to look out for is club root, which
causes the roots to swell up.</text><text start="726.769" dur="1.01">If you find this, make sure</text><text start="727.779" dur="4.871">you either burn the plants or destroy them
before they pass the disease onto the other</text><text start="732.65" dur="1.22">cabbages.</text><text start="733.87" dur="5.6">Liming helps to deter club root, as does growing
the cabbages in a different bed each year.</text><text start="739.47" dur="2.11">Basic Information and Aspects for cabbages
include</text><text start="741.58" dur="1.509">Gender: is Feminine</text><text start="743.089" dur="1.401">Planet: is the Moon</text><text start="744.49" dur="1">Element: is Water</text><text start="745.49" dur="1.24">Powers: are for Luck</text><text start="746.73" dur="5.07">Magickal Uses: Plant cabbages first thing
after a couple has gotten married in the garden</text><text start="751.8" dur="1">of the</text><text start="752.8" dur="2.76">couple, especially if they wish to have good
luck in their marriage and garden.</text><text start="755.56" dur="4">Today we will share a simple Apple Crisp recipe.</text><text start="759.56" dur="2.26">Use this to increase loving and harmonious</text><text start="761.82" dur="2.17">energy in relationships.</text><text start="763.99" dur="3.33">Also helpful for helping someone understand
the emotional level of a</text><text start="767.32" dur="1.35">situation.</text><text start="768.67" dur="7.229">Start by preheating your oven to 375 degrees

just as each person needs to come together</text><text start="797.649" dur="1">to create</text><text start="798.649" dur="1">the ideal relationship.</text><text start="799.649" dur="7.291">In a separate bowl, sift one cup of all-purpose
flour, 3⁄4 of a cup of granulated sugar,</text><text start="806.94" dur="1.06">1⁄2 teaspoon</text><text start="808" dur="3.45">cinnamon and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt.</text><text start="811.45" dur="3.99">Incorporate 1⁄2 cup of softened butter by

Magical Circle School and welcome to my segment</text><text start="1095.21" dur="25.949">titled Ask A Witch, where people may write
in and ask a question that I will answer to</text><text start="1121.159" dur="5.091">the best of</text><text start="1126.25" dur="5.059">my abilities.</text><text start="1131.309" dur="4.35">Today&amp;#39;s question comes from Belinda, who writes:</text><text start="1135.659" dur="15.661">What is the best way to send healing energy
at a distance to multiple loved ones with</text><text start="1151.32" dur="1">multiple</text><text start="1152.32" dur="4.12">diagnoses without wearing yourself out?</text><text start="1156.44" dur="2.81">Merry meet, Belinda.</text><text start="1159.25" dur="13.659">Well this can be tricky depending on the type
of healing you are choosing to</text><text start="1172.909" dur="10.51">do, the amount of people that you are trying
to heal, and how often you do it.</text><text start="1183.419" dur="3.651">One thing that I have</text><text start="1187.07" dur="9.64">learned is that a little goes a long way.</text><text start="1196.71" dur="5.449">Typically, when I am sending out healing,
I do it every</text><text start="1202.159" dur="2.311">morning at the same time.</text><text start="1204.47" dur="6.66">I keep a simple healing altar set up in my
kitchen on my windowsill and</text><text start="1211.13" dur="13.369">on it I have a candle that I light every morning
and a mug that I put the names of people I</text><text start="1224.499" dur="1">am</text><text start="1225.499" dur="1">sending out energy to.</text><text start="1226.499" dur="6.23">I think of each person and see them in my
mind&amp;#39;s eye as doing well.</text><text start="1232.729" dur="1">Then I</text><text start="1233.729" dur="4.511">go about my day.</text><text start="1238.24" dur="16.029">The key is to remember, you aren&amp;#39;t going to
cure them completely, but help the</text><text start="1254.269" dur="1.13">recovery along.</text><text start="1255.399" dur="5.821">Then every month, or whenever I feel my energy
has gotten low, I recharge it by</text><text start="1261.22" dur="1.86">doing a vinegar bath.</text><text start="1263.08" dur="5.589">I suggest listening to the Protective Magick
lecture in the Lecture Hall.</text><text start="1268.669" dur="3.301">Our next question comes from Andy Velez</text><text start="1271.97" dur="13.799">One aspect of my own journey that I would
like to work on is incorporating more physical</text><text start="1285.769" dur="1">activity</text><text start="1286.769" dur="1">and exercise.</text><text start="1287.769" dur="8.191">Is there a type of exercise or physical activity
that you particularly enjoy?</text><text start="1295.96" dur="1">Does this</text><text start="1296.96" dur="4.25">facilitate an opportunity for meditation or
other spiritual practices?</text><text start="1301.21" dur="1.429">Merry meet, Andy.</text><text start="1302.639" dur="5.551">Well I tend to struggle when it comes to being
active.</text><text start="1308.19" dur="3.32">I spend a lot of time at</text><text start="1311.51" dur="9.739">my computer desk and doing school work that
I tend to forget everything else that is going</text><text start="1321.249" dur="1.25">on</text><text start="1322.499" dur="2.5">around me.</text><text start="1324.999" dur="7.121">For a while I was doing well, got a fitbit
and started the Hungry Girl diet and started</text><text start="1332.12" dur="2.2">losing weight and inches.</text><text start="1334.32" dur="6.559">Then I went to the doctor and my confidence
was blown when I felt I</text><text start="1340.879" dur="10.03">was doing well and looking better and feeling
better.</text><text start="1350.909" dur="9.23">I told him I had a fit bit and he looked at
me</text><text start="1360.139" dur="3">and said “Yeah, but are you using it?”</text><text start="1363.139" dur="6.24">When I said I had to go out and buy a bunch
of new clothes</text><text start="1369.379" dur="6.201">because I have lost 2 dress sizes he actually
chuckled.</text><text start="1375.58" dur="5.569">Needless to say I am in the market for a</text><text start="1381.149" dur="1.51">new doctor.</text><text start="1382.659" dur="8.75">But I digress, hopefully I will get back on
track again here soon.</text><text start="1391.409" dur="2.87">I am planning on</text><text start="1394.279" dur="10.821">restarting the diet, which is only a 4 week
diet, to re-kick start that.</text><text start="1405.1" dur="8.749">I have a treadmill that I was</text><text start="1413.849" dur="27.371">doing an hour walk on every day, plus every
hour my fit bit reminds me to do 250 steps,</text><text start="1441.22" dur="1.039">so I was</text><text start="1442.259" dur="2.51">averaging a little over 10,000 steps a day.</text><text start="1444.769" dur="6.801">And then on top of that I was doing 45 minute
work out</text><text start="1451.57" dur="8.899">dvds, I am really liking the Goddess Workout,
which is a belly dance work out video.</text><text start="1460.469" dur="1.481">There are 4</text><text start="1461.95" dur="5.37">dvds in the package and granted I have only
done the first one so far, but I enjoyed it.</text><text start="1467.32" dur="1">I also do</text><text start="1468.32" dur="1.799">meditate every day, I take some time for me
be it in the shower or before bed or in the</text><text start="1470.119" dur="1">morning</text><text start="1471.119" dur="1.44">when I am sending out healing energy to people,
I find that taking at least 5 minutes to connect</text><text start="1472.559" dur="1">spiritually helps me out a lot every day.</text><text start="1473.559" dur="1">Our third question comes from Andrew Ragan</text><text start="1474.559" dur="1">As I have been seeing there are different
ways to defeat illness.</text><text start="1475.559" dur="1">Which would you choose?</text><text start="1476.559" dur="1">Spells</text><text start="1477.559" dur="1">or homeopathic remedies, and how do you make
the determination which one would be more</text><text start="1478.559" dur="1">beneficial?</text><text start="1479.559" dur="1">Merry meet, Andrew.</text><text start="1480.559" dur="1">Well, it really depends on the illness and
what the doctors and medical</text><text start="1481.559" dur="1">professionals advise us to do.</text><text start="1482.559" dur="1">For the most part, my view is that there is
only so much we can do</text><text start="1483.559" dur="1">and only so much the professionals can do....however
if we work together maybe we can find a</text><text start="1484.559" dur="1">way to help things work better.</text><text start="1485.559" dur="1">It would be nice if there was a spell or a
herb that would</text><text start="1486.559" dur="1">completely cure us, but unfortunately the
reality is we can move towards feeling better,</text><text start="1487.559" dur="1">but</text><text start="1488.559" dur="1">illnesses and each person&amp;#39;s body&amp;#39;s chemistry
is different.</text><text start="1489.559" dur="1">What may work for one person may not</text><text start="1490.559" dur="1">work for another, what helps one person may
cause the opposite in another person.</text><text start="1491.559" dur="1">First and</text><text start="1492.559" dur="1">foremost, you should always talk to a medical
professional.</text><text start="1493.559" dur="1">They have the training and the</text><text start="1494.559" dur="1">understanding of the body and usually have
recommendations.</text><text start="1495.559" dur="1">Holistic medicine is a trial and error</text><text start="1496.559" dur="1">type of practice.</text><text start="1497.559" dur="1">Sometimes things can help you along, sometimes
things don&amp;#39;t work like you had</text><text start="1498.559" dur="1">hoped and some times what the medical professional
gives you will react poorly to a holistic</text><text start="1499.559" dur="1">add</text><text start="1500.559" dur="1">on, so always ask and talk to your doctors
about it and make sure that what you are doing</text><text start="1501.559" dur="1">to help</text><text start="1502.559" dur="1">the healing forward will not be preventing
the other medications to not perform correctly.</text><text start="1503.559" dur="1">However the first thing is to understand your
diagnosis, then understand what the traditional</text><text start="1504.559" dur="1">cure</text><text start="1505.559" dur="1">is, and then look up the different possible
ways to help that cure out.</text><text start="1506.559" dur="1">Positive energy helps a bit, a</text><text start="1507.559" dur="1">good attitude and good sense of humor help
out in the healing process.</text><text start="1508.559" dur="1">But a lot of it is trial and</text><text start="1509.559" dur="1">error.</text><text start="1510.559" dur="1">I do hope that this has helped you out some.</text><text start="1511.559" dur="1">If you have a question please contact me at
ccriswelltmc@gmail.com with the subject line</text><text start="1512.559" dur="1">Ask A</text><text start="1513.559" dur="1">Witch and I will do my best to answer your
questions!</text><text start="1514.559" dur="1">Merry Meet and welcome to the deity segment
for October, I’m Steven and this month we’ll</text><text start="1515.559" dur="1">be discussing a Voodoo loa named Legba (or
Papa Legba, to His followers).</text><text start="1516.559" dur="1">Mostly followed and evoked by the followers
of Haitian and New Orlean Voodoo, this God</text><text start="1517.559" dur="1">(or, Loa, as they’re referred to) is often
viewed as an elderly black man with a cane</text><text start="1518.559" dur="1">and straw hat, often he’s thought to sprinkle
water upon the ground or, alternately, smoking</text><text start="1519.559" dur="1">a pipe.</text><text start="1520.559" dur="1">He is often accompanied by a black dog or
rooster (which is an animal often given in</text><text start="1521.559" dur="1">offering of the Loa).</text><text start="1522.559" dur="1">Legba (often referred to as Legba Ati-bon)
is often the first and last spirit invoked</text><text start="1523.559" dur="1">within the Voodoo traditional rites and rituals,
this is because of His stance as the Gatekeeping</text><text start="1524.559" dur="1">Loa.</text><text start="1525.559" dur="1">He allows the passage by loa from their world
to this and, as such, is considered a very</text><text start="1526.559" dur="1">powerful God.</text><text start="1527.559" dur="1">His ability to keep the crossroads makes Him
a trickster by nature and, with this, comes</text><text start="1528.559" dur="1">the masterful control He has over the languages
of the human species.</text><text start="1529.559" dur="1">He can communicate with anyone He chooses,
supposedly, in any language He chooses to</text><text start="1530.559" dur="1">use.</text><text start="1531.559" dur="1">He speaks frequently with the other loas and
orders them to stay where He can watch them</text><text start="1532.559" dur="2.181">until they are given permission to leave His
company.</text><text start="1534.74" dur="6.609">This being said, it often leads people to
be unable to contact the Loa for any reason</text><text start="1541.349" dur="4.32">as they have angered Legba.</text><text start="1545.669" dur="8.23">Always bare-footed, Legba is in constant contact
with the Earth and, through this, He finds</text><text start="1553.899" dur="1.311">power.</text><text start="1555.21" dur="7.93">His symbol is the Sun and He is a polite Loa,
it is these manners and His further caring</text><text start="1563.14" dur="8.829">nature which earns Him the title ‘Papa’,
He is considered a much loved Loa.</text><text start="1571.969" dur="6.96">When Legba mounts someone (this is the word
used for the time when a Loa of Voodoo will</text><text start="1578.929" dur="8.771">be invoked into someone) they are often said
to experience great pain due to His twisted</text><text start="1587.7" dur="2.31">and crippled limbs.</text><text start="1590.01" dur="6.72">This Loa should be honoured on November 1st,
which is All Saints Day and can be offered</text><text start="1596.73" dur="7.989">a rooster, or some part of it or, if this
is something unavailable, some pipe tobacco</text><text start="1604.719" dur="1.721">would please Him too.</text><text start="1606.44" dur="8.52">His colours are black, gold and rose, His
day is Tuesday, and an offering of vegetables,</text><text start="1614.96" dur="8.049">meats or mushrooms which have been grilled
upon open flames or a barbecue should be given</text><text start="1623.009" dur="5.191">in order to have Him open the portal to the
other world.</text><text start="1628.2" dur="24.439">My name is Steven, thank you for listening
to the Deity segment for October.</text><text start="1652.639" dur="9">Merry Part.</text><text start="1661.639" dur="4.951">Merry Meet and welcome to the Creature Feature
for October, my name is Freyja Mahogany and</text><text start="1666.59" dur="4.15">this month, we’re doing something a little
different, I thought – since it’s Samhain</text><text start="1670.74" dur="4">month and that also means Halloween, that
we’d cover something altogether outside</text><text start="1674.74" dur="3.169">of the norm.</text><text start="1677.909" dur="5.061">As we’re all aware, there are many different
poems and stories covering mystical and mythical</text><text start="1682.97" dur="2.389">creatures, lots of them somewhat eerie.</text><text start="1685.359" dur="6.341">I thought hearing a few excerpts from some
of my favourites might inspire some of you</text><text start="1691.7" dur="6.959">to go out and write your own, do some research
on what you hear or even just sit and enjoy</text><text start="1698.659" dur="1.431">the tales for what they are.</text><text start="1700.09" dur="5.73">I realise this isn’t the standard layout
of the Creature Feature but I’m hoping you’ll</text><text start="1705.82" dur="1.549">enjoy it none-the-less.</text><text start="1707.369" dur="8.98">We’ll start with an excerpt I remember well
from my childhood in Scotland, from the late</text><text start="1716.349" dur="6.07">Robert Burns’ tale “Tam O’ Shanter”.</text><text start="1722.419" dur="10.59">To set the scene, old Tam has had far too
much to drink and comes across this sight</text><text start="1733.009" dur="10.371">within Kirk Alloway, the excerpt begins as
Tam looks through one of the windows.</text><text start="1743.38" dur="4.029">“Warlocks and witches in a dance;

as the breeze,</text><text start="2004.779" dur="3.14">    Vocal are they, like storm-bewilder&amp;#39;d
seas.</text><text start="2007.919" dur="3.47">    Their faces are the fair, unshrouded
night,</text><text start="2011.389" dur="3.821">    And planets are their eyes, their
ageless dreams.</text><text start="2015.21" dur="2.289">    Tenderly stooping earthward from their
height,</text><text start="2017.499" dur="2.99">    They wander in the dusk with chanting
streams;</text><text start="2020.489" dur="3.25">    And they are dawn-lit trees, with
arms up-flung,</text><text start="2023.739" dur="9.27">    To hail the burning heavens they left
unsung.</text><text start="2033.009" dur="9.5">I’m going to leave you today with words
spoken by the fairy Puck himself, from William</text><text start="2042.509" dur="3.201">Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”.</text><text start="2045.71" dur="5.09">“If we shadows have offended,
Think but this and all is mended,</text><text start="2050.8" dur="4.74">That you have but slumber&amp;#39;d here
While these visions did appear.</text><text start="2055.54" dur="3.76">And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,</text><text start="2059.3" dur="5.24">Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend.</text><text start="2064.54" dur="3.889">And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearnéd luck</text><text start="2068.429" dur="6.2">Now to &amp;#39;scape the serpent&amp;#39;s tongue,
We will make amends ere long;</text><text start="2074.629" dur="4.072">Else the Puck a liar call:
So, good night unto you all.</text><text start="2078.701" dur="7.109">Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.”</text><text start="2085.81" dur="4.21">I have been Freyja Mahogany, this has been

the first card we have the twins, which show</text><text start="2174.41" dur="1">a mother</text><text start="2175.41" dur="5.02">cradling a rabbit and watching over her adult
twin sons, Thunder and Lightning, as they</text><text start="2180.43" dur="1">play on</text><text start="2181.43" dur="2.409">the beach in the water and sand.</text><text start="2183.839" dur="3.631">The background is a double sun with each shining
its reflection</text><text start="2187.47" dur="1.599">on the water.</text><text start="2189.069" dur="4.881">There is somebody who views themself as a

it.</text><text start="2204.81" dur="2.88">Notice she is cradling a rabbit.</text><text start="2207.69" dur="1.179">In many Native</text><text start="2208.869" dur="6.44">American lores the rabbit is a trickster which
encourages us to look before we leap and to</text><text start="2215.309" dur="3.321">carefully consider choices before action.</text><text start="2218.63" dur="4.03">On the other end they are also symbolic of
speed and</text><text start="2222.66" dur="7.389">enourage fast moment when it&amp;#39;s needed.</text><text start="2230.049" dur="1.111">Next card is the Willow.</text><text start="2231.16" dur="5.15">In this one we see a Native American seated
cross legged underneath a</text><text start="2236.31" dur="1">willow tree.</text><text start="2237.31" dur="5.07">He is dressed in traditional robe and headdress
and two decorated poles are erected.</text><text start="2242.38" dur="10.08">The tree&amp;#39;s branches are long and bear colorful
flowers which tells me maybe springtime or</text><text start="2252.46" dur="1">early</text><text start="2253.46" dur="1.32">summer.</text><text start="2254.78" dur="5.789">There is a circle of stones built around the
area and a hint of a bubbling brook nearby.</text><text start="2260.569" dur="5.351">The willow tree is a very useful tree not
only does it provide a little bit of shelter</text><text start="2265.92" dur="1.37">and a sense of</text><text start="2267.29" dur="4.269">security but it can be made into medicines
and useful products as well.</text><text start="2271.559" dur="2.04">That is what the woman</text><text start="2273.599" dur="9.291">hanging about you is serving as, in a spiritual
sense, as you look for and find your path</text><text start="2282.89" dur="1.399">or seek</text><text start="2284.289" dur="1.391">your answers.</text><text start="2285.68" dur="4.889">The next card I draw is water.</text><text start="2290.569" dur="2.201">It shows a image of a woman up to her eyes

on ice.</text><text start="2298.8" dur="3.26">Water is very symbolic of emotion.</text><text start="2302.06" dur="1">It</text><text start="2303.06" dur="3.24">also is a symbol of the hidden and unseen.</text><text start="2306.3" dur="1.739">The sea lion in many native american cultures</text><text start="2308.039" dur="6.651">represent not only protection from danger
but lucid dreaming and messages.</text><text start="2314.69" dur="1.389">Do you dream of this</text><text start="2316.079" dur="3.381">woman or get any kind of advice in your sleep?</text><text start="2319.46" dur="8.74">I would start paying attention to those dreams
if</text><text start="2328.2" dur="1">you do.</text><text start="2329.2" dur="1">Finally I&amp;#39;ve drawn turkey.</text><text start="2330.2" dur="2.06">Here we see some native americans dancing
around a turkey with</text><text start="2332.26" dur="3.23">debris, feather and stones all up in the air.</text><text start="2335.49" dur="4.74">His eyes are closed while the Native americans
look</text><text start="2340.23" dur="2.369">joyful and celebratory.</text><text start="2342.599" dur="4.23">NAtive Americans took birds of all types as
messengers of the Great Spirit</text><text start="2346.829" dur="4.831">and when they appeared they have something
to teach.</text><text start="2351.66" dur="2.46">The Turkey specifically also represented</text><text start="2354.12" dur="2.41">nourishment, leadership and strength.</text><text start="2356.53" dur="6.66">So recapping, You wanted to know about a woman
that people say is around you.</text><text start="2363.19" dur="1">The cards</text><text start="2364.19" dur="5.359">didn&amp;#39;t tell me so much about her as they did
about the purpose she has in your life right</text><text start="2369.549" dur="1">now.</text><text start="2370.549" dur="1">She</text><text start="2371.549" dur="5.57">is most likely an ancestor or at least someone
who has taken on a motherly role for you in</text><text start="2377.119" dur="5.95">teaching, guiding, protecting and helping
you find your way down your path in a healthy</text><text start="2383.069" dur="1">way.</text><text start="2384.069" dur="1">She</text><text start="2385.069" dur="5.341">remains very hidden but she is there and celebrates
with joy when you make good choices and</text><text start="2390.41" dur="4.959">show the leadership qualities you were meant
to have and when you need her she is there</text><text start="2395.369" dur="3.141">at your</text><text start="2398.51" dur="7.87">back to give you strength.</text><text start="2406.38" dur="4.719">God bless, Yonu.</text><text start="2411.099" dur="14.131">Merry Meet, Freyja here with your Reading
the Numbers segment.</text><text start="2425.23" dur="4.21">This month we’ll be looking at the numbers
of Destynee Myshelle Worthen.</text><text start="2429.44" dur="2.46">Destynee, your Life Path number is 6.</text><text start="2431.9" dur="4.85">The Life Path of 8 is reserved for those with
practical, down-to-Earth wants in life.</text><text start="2436.75" dur="4.49">It is the number of material gain and the
urge to be fulfilled financially whatever</text><text start="2441.24" dur="5.279">the cost, you will be frugal and careful with
money until the urge takes you, when you’ll</text><text start="2446.519" dur="3.51">flourish into a spending frenzy.</text><text start="2450.029" dur="3.721">You will often compare your material wealth
to that of those around you and feel down</text><text start="2453.75" dur="3.75">if you do not find your wealth exceeding theirs.</text><text start="2457.5" dur="4.63">Ambitious and self-confident, you have a natural
want to lead the group, rather than follow</text><text start="2462.13" dur="4.331">and, whilst this I often a great characteristic
that one should be proud of, it can often</text><text start="2466.461" dur="3.058">lead you into trouble with your boss or team
leaders.</text><text start="2469.519" dur="4.441">You are capable, organised, and inspirational
which should aid you in getting to the top</text><text start="2473.96" dur="1.49">of the ladder.</text><text start="2475.45" dur="3.159">Rigidity and stubbornness run in your veins
making you a difficult person to work with,</text><text start="2478.609" dur="5.89">and your inability to see other ways to do
things only add to this issue.</text><text start="2484.499" dur="4.481">You will attract financial success more than
any other number and, while this is a positive,</text><text start="2488.98" dur="4.359">it will often come at the cost of your friendships,
familial relationships and the health and</text><text start="2493.339" dur="1.201">wellbeing of others.</text><text start="2494.54" dur="5.079">You are ruthless in your goal-orientation
and will find great satisfaction in reaching</text><text start="2499.619" dur="2.25">your accumulative goals.</text><text start="2501.869" dur="4.901">Politics and social work would be good career
paths for you, as would something in the judicial</text><text start="2506.77" dur="1.69">system.</text><text start="2508.46" dur="3.94">Most eights (like you) have a tendency to
keep others dependant upon them for longer</text><text start="2512.4" dur="2.16">than is completely necessary.</text><text start="2514.56" dur="5.67">You can find yourself becoming isolated, seeking
conflict and unable to communicate effectively,</text><text start="2520.23" dur="2.789">this is due to the domineering nature of your
character.</text><text start="2523.019" dur="4.241">Don’t blame yourself for your faults though,
these are often as a result of your upbringing,</text><text start="2527.26" dur="3.45">by someone abusive, whether within the family
or outwith.</text><text start="2530.71" dur="7.359">Your expression number is nine, this shows
that you are artistic, personable, and a calming</text><text start="2538.069" dur="1.421">influence on those around you.</text><text start="2539.49" dur="6.43">You are a person who seeks balance and diplomacy
in all situations; this is something that</text><text start="2545.92" dur="4.53">people can see about you and will often latch
onto this as something they like about you;</text><text start="2550.45" dur="4.33">it can lead you into lots of different friendships
with lots of different people.</text><text start="2554.78" dur="3.579">This number also reveals that you are an artistic
person, this is something you will find is</text><text start="2558.359" dur="2.75">a relaxant in your life.</text><text start="2561.109" dur="4.361">You must be wary of people trying to throw
off your balance with mean words or energy</text><text start="2565.47" dur="3.97">sapping; this is something that will happen
often when people realise that you are such</text><text start="2569.44" dur="2.889">a pool of calming energy.</text><text start="2572.329" dur="5.342">You can protect yourself in many ways, one
of the best for a two like you, is that of</text><text start="2577.671" dur="3.869">speaking to those you love and hold dear,
you should ensure that your friends are people</text><text start="2581.54" dur="4.23">who want only the best for you and, though
it can be difficult to let go of those people</text><text start="2585.77" dur="4.72">who drag you down this is really the best
course of action.</text><text start="2590.49" dur="3.45">You are open-minded and willing to get in
there, get mucky, and try it out; even if</text><text start="2593.94" dur="4.14">it doesn’t always conclude in success, this
doesn’t often get you down though; you tend</text><text start="2598.08" dur="3.91">to look upon your failures as an adventure
into education, rather than a misguided attempt</text><text start="2601.99" dur="2.299">at something.</text><text start="2604.289" dur="4.221">This serves you so well as you gather knowledge
and store it from each and every experience</text><text start="2608.51" dur="1.37">you have.</text><text start="2609.88" dur="4.27">Your love and need for calm and tranquil settings
in your life can often lead to an issue in</text><text start="2614.15" dur="2.24">one area of your life, though…</text><text start="2616.39" dur="4.22">Parenting, where the firm hand is sometimes
the best approach.</text><text start="2620.61" dur="4.97">This is not to say that you’re a bad parent,
more that you need time to adjust to the idea</text><text start="2625.58" dur="3.689">that putting your foot down is something that
is essential in the parenting world.</text><text start="2629.269" dur="5.07">With a good sense of rhythm and great musical
talent, you possess all the skills necessary</text><text start="2634.339" dur="7.061">for a great musical career, though you probably
won’t pursue it for fear of rejection.</text><text start="2641.4" dur="7.88">Your Soul Urge is five, this is a number of
travel, new experiences and change.</text><text start="2649.28" dur="5.15">You like far-off places and adventures, nothing
makes you happier than running free, able</text><text start="2654.43" dur="1.629">to do as you please.</text><text start="2656.059" dur="1">Merry Meet and Welcome to WTMC The Magical
Circle School&amp;#39;s Podcast. In this months Podcast</text><text start="2657.059" dur="1">we have the crafting club segment with DannielleRae,
the kitchen witch segment with DannielleRae,</text><text start="2658.059" dur="1">we will catch up with the Book Club with Colleen,
ask a witch with Colleen, the deity segment</text><text start="2659.059" dur="1">with myself Steven, the Creature Feature with
Freyja, the Tarot Table with Jen, Reading</text><text start="2660.059" dur="1">the Numbers with Freyja, we find out who won
the Spell of the Month contest with Colleen</text><text start="2661.059" dur="1">and we have the getting to know your class
segment with DannielleRae. Hi!I&amp;#39;m DannielleRae</text><text start="2662.059" dur="1">with the Crafting Club Updates.
Current theme of the month is dream pillows</text><text start="2663.059" dur="1">and sachets, and I have personally experimented
with</text><text start="2664.059" dur="1">a couple different dried herbs and aromatics
with some success, and some failure. Kind</text><text start="2665.059" dur="1">of
amazing how the energies can be compatible,</text><text start="2666.059" dur="1">but the scents don&amp;#39;t blend the way you think
they</text><text start="2667.059" dur="1">should.
Our upcoming theme of the month is staffs</text><text start="2668.059" dur="1">and wands... This is a tool that you can choose
already</text><text start="2669.059" dur="1">found and made all yours by personalization
and consecration, or you can start from scratch</text><text start="2670.059" dur="1">finding the raw materials yourself. While
using wood is the most common start for crafting</text><text start="2671.059" dur="1">either
the staff or wand, you may choose a material</text><text start="2672.059" dur="1">that calls to you. I&amp;#39;ve seen blown glass,
beaded</text><text start="2673.059" dur="1">creations, even assembled and wired gemstones
that can serve as wands.</text><text start="2674.059" dur="1">The more traditional route is to opt for a
branch from a chosen tree, bush, or even matured</text><text start="2675.059" dur="1">herb
plant. The kind of source that you pick can</text><text start="2676.059" dur="1">be completely random, as in a fallen limb
from a tree</text><text start="2677.059" dur="1">that you find during a walk through the woods,
or this can be a very deliberate choice made</text><text start="2678.059" dur="1">specifically for the energies of a host tree.
Research some tree associations to find something</text><text start="2679.059" dur="1">that
is in line with your purposes, or the kind</text><text start="2680.059" dur="1">of magick that you are attracted to.
There are some different schools of thought</text><text start="2681.059" dur="1">on how to obtain the perfect piece to craft
a wand or</text><text start="2682.059" dur="1">staff. You can pick the part of a living tree
or bush and communicate your intent and your</text><text start="2683.059" dur="1">thanks
for the gift that you will cut from the tree.</text><text start="2684.059" dur="1">If you go this route, be sure you research
the best time</text><text start="2685.059" dur="1">and way to harvest your branch so that you
will inflict less damage to the host. However,</text><text start="2686.059" dur="1">other
practitioners believe that this is never a</text><text start="2687.059" dur="1">good thing to do, and you simply must wait
for the gift.</text><text start="2688.059" dur="1">The choice that you make leads you into the
next basic step of how to craft the wand or</text><text start="2689.059" dur="1">staff. Will
you strip the bark? Carve symbols or words</text><text start="2690.059" dur="1">into the wood? But, is that the next step
for you?</text><text start="2691.059" dur="1">When do you attune the wand or staff? Is this
before or during the crafting process? Is</text><text start="2692.059" dur="1">this
something that you do after you have personalized</text><text start="2693.059" dur="1">it and have had a chance to experience the
energy that resides within?</text><text start="2694.059" dur="1">This is the journey of witch crafting...and
we want to discuss this process with you.</text><text start="2695.059" dur="1">Come and
share your experiences, or maybe you will</text><text start="2696.059" dur="1">get inspired to try to craft your own wand
or staff.</text><text start="2697.059" dur="1">Join the Crafting Club and get involved with
like-minded crafters. Who knows what you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="2698.059" dur="1">be
inspired to try.</text><text start="2699.059" dur="1">HI, I am DannielleRae!
Welcome to the Kitchen Witch Club updates.</text><text start="2700.059" dur="1">This month in the Plant of the Month series,
we will discuss harvesting apples, and sowing</text><text start="2701.059" dur="1">spring
cabbages.</text><text start="2702.059" dur="1">The apple is such a versatile fruit, that
it can be considered the white candle of magick.</text><text start="2703.059" dur="1">Every part
of the apple can be used, and the apple tree</text><text start="2704.059" dur="1">itself produces usable magickal tools throughout
the</text><text start="2705.059" dur="1">year.
For instance, The leaves of an apple tree</text><text start="2706.059" dur="1">can be harvested at anytime, and dried like
any other</text><text start="2707.059" dur="1">herb. Apple blossoms are a five petaled bud
that reveals a striking flower, usually pink</text><text start="2708.059" dur="1">on the
outside and white on the inside. These are</text><text start="2709.059" dur="1">harvested in the spring time and can be dried
and stored</text><text start="2710.059" dur="1">for spellwork, spiritual offerings, or can
be used in teas and other edible recipes.</text><text start="2711.059" dur="1">When apple
blossoms are fertilized either by itself,</text><text start="2712.059" dur="1">as in self-pollinating varieties or the pollen
of another</text><text start="2713.059" dur="1">companion tree, the base of the bottom actually
grows to become the fruit.</text><text start="2714.059" dur="1">There are four basic groups of cultivars:
Early flowering, midseason flowering, late-season</text><text start="2715.059" dur="1">flowering and very-late-season flowering.
Here in the United States, there are more</text><text start="2716.059" dur="1">than 100
different varieties that are grown commercially,</text><text start="2717.059" dur="1">so our supermarket and produce stands seem
to</text><text start="2718.059" dur="1">always have some sort of apples available,
no matter the time of the year. Worldwide</text><text start="2719.059" dur="1">there are
more than 7500 varieties of apples, so chances</text><text start="2720.059" dur="1">are, no matter where in the world you are,
there is</text><text start="2721.059" dur="1">an apple available! The most popular varieties
include Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Granny</text><text start="2722.059" dur="1">Smith, McIntosh, Rome Beauty, Fuji, Jonathan,
York, Gala, Idared, and Yellow Newton.</text><text start="2723.059" dur="1">Apple trees can grow from 10 to 30 feet tall,
and can easily be as wide. The tree itself</text><text start="2724.059" dur="1">may live for
more than 100 years. The older the tree the</text><text start="2725.059" dur="1">longer it takes the fruit to mature. It can
take several</text><text start="2726.059" dur="1">years for a new apple tree to bear fruit that
is acceptable – anywhere from 3-6 years</text><text start="2727.059" dur="1">depending on
the variety. It can take 100 to 200 days for</text><text start="2728.059" dur="1">the fruit to mature enough for harvest. It
can be</text><text start="2729.059" dur="1">difficult to gauge the maturity from skin
color alone. A mature apple is easily picked</text><text start="2730.059" dur="1">from the tree
and won&amp;#39;t require being cut from it. However,</text><text start="2731.059" dur="1">the best test is to taste the apple. This
will reveal if</text><text start="2732.059" dur="1">the apple is sour, or starchy. The apples
should be firm and crisp, but the flavor needs</text><text start="2733.059" dur="1">to be right.
Once picked, the apples need to be sorted.</text><text start="2734.059" dur="1">The ones with damage or blights need to be
used or</text><text start="2735.059" dur="1">tossed right away. The saying that, “one
bad apple spoils the whole barrel” has merits.</text><text start="2736.059" dur="1">If one bad
apple is stored with the good ones, soon the</text><text start="2737.059" dur="1">whole bunch of them will turn bad. This is
actually</text><text start="2738.059" dur="1">based on the production of ethylene gases,
but we don&amp;#39;t have to get that scientific.</text><text start="2739.059" dur="1">Simply, store
your apples in a cool dry place, sorted by</text><text start="2740.059" dur="1">size. Use larger apples first, since the smaller
will keep</text><text start="2741.059" dur="1">fresh for longer. The apples with the stems
intact will also store longer.</text><text start="2742.059" dur="1">Apples are so treasured that many cultures
have history of giving offerings to the trees</text><text start="2743.059" dur="1">themselves,
in hopes that they would have an abundant</text><text start="2744.059" dur="1">harvest in the next year. Pouring apple cider
or juice</text><text start="2745.059" dur="1">on the ground of the tree or in any of your
garden areas is done to promote the fertility</text><text start="2746.059" dur="1">of the soil.
Apples are often used in spellwork, because</text><text start="2747.059" dur="1">the apple itself, when cut width-wise reveals
a 5-</text><text start="2748.059" dur="1">pointed star.
Basic Information and Aspects for apples include</text><text start="2749.059" dur="1">Common Folk Names: such as Fruit of the Gods,

one that you love or in other love spells.</text><text start="2755.059" dur="1">Cut the apple, rub the pieces on your body
and bury them</text><text start="2756.059" dur="1">for localized healing. After a storm, gather
branches from apple trees to use for wands</text><text start="2757.059" dur="1">or wreaths
to promote emotional magick and the element</text><text start="2758.059" dur="1">of water.
Spring Cabbage– Sow</text><text start="2759.059" dur="1">To go along with our apples, we have spring
cabbages to sow for the upcoming colder months.</text><text start="2760.059" dur="1">Believe it or not, I was a bit skeptical on
if the harvesting chart was correct. Spring</text><text start="2761.059" dur="1">cabbages in
this time of the year? Didn&amp;#39;t make sense.</text><text start="2762.059" dur="1">After a lot of research, there is a huge amount
of varieties</text><text start="2763.059" dur="1">available when it comes to cabbages, and you
can actually have them all year round as long</text><text start="2764.059" dur="1">as you
plan! So &amp;#39;spring cabbage&amp;#39; may not necessarily</text><text start="2765.059" dur="1">be the type you will be sowing this month.
I&amp;#39;ll start with the different varieties encase</text><text start="2766.059" dur="1">you still need to choose them.

Drumhead; Red Dutch; Ruby Ball; and Vesta.</text><text start="2773.059" dur="1">So, sowing time for &amp;#39;spring&amp;#39; cabbage is actually
late summer, so perfect to sow now or even</text><text start="2774.059" dur="1">in the
next month. Sow them about 1 cm/ 1⁄2 inch</text><text start="2775.059" dur="1">down in the earth, with the distance between
rows 15</text><text start="2776.059" dur="1">cm/ 6 inches and then plant the seeds 30-38
cm/ 12-15 inches apart. Basically just give</text><text start="2777.059" dur="1">them
enough room to grow! These cabbages will be</text><text start="2778.059" dur="1">harvested in the spring.
They do their best growing in open sunny places,</text><text start="2779.059" dur="1">in soils that are fertile and reasonably free
for</text><text start="2780.059" dur="1">draining. If you&amp;#39;re growing them inside first,
then give them about 4-5 weeks until they</text><text start="2781.059" dur="1">have about</text><text start="2782.059" dur="1">four or five leaves and then move them to
their final resting place. Make sure you firm</text><text start="2783.059" dur="1">the soil</text><text start="2784.059" dur="1">around the roots once you&amp;#39;ve moved them, this
can be done using a trowel though I&amp;#39;m sure</text><text start="2785.059" dur="1">patting</text><text start="2786.059" dur="1">it with your hands works just as well! Water
them well and keep watering until they have</text><text start="2787.059" dur="1">become</text><text start="2788.059" dur="1">established. Don&amp;#39;t forget to hoe regularly
and keep the weeds away. Draw up the soil</text><text start="2789.059" dur="1">around the</text><text start="2790.059" dur="1">stems for overwintering varieties and remove
any dead leaves.</text><text start="2791.059" dur="1">There are some pests and diseases to look
out for. Mainly cabbage root fly, but these</text><text start="2792.059" dur="1">can be taken</text><text start="2793.059" dur="1">care of by protecting the roots and stems
of the cabbage with a collar. The collar can</text><text start="2794.059" dur="1">be made of</text><text start="2795.059" dur="1">roof felt or similar materials. This prevents
the flies from laying their eggs. Keep and</text><text start="2796.059" dur="1">eye out for</text><text start="2797.059" dur="1">caterpillars, and flea beetles. Also slugs
and snails need to be kept an eye on. However,</text><text start="2798.059" dur="1">the worst</text><text start="2799.059" dur="1">thing to look out for is club root, which
causes the roots to swell up. If you find</text><text start="2800.059" dur="1">this, make sure</text><text start="2801.059" dur="1">you either burn the plants or destroy them
before they pass the disease onto the other</text><text start="2802.059" dur="1">cabbages.</text><text start="2803.059" dur="1">Liming helps to deter club root, as does growing
the cabbages in a different bed each year.</text><text start="2804.059" dur="1">Basic Information and Aspects for cabbages

Merry Meet, I am Colleen Criswell from The</text><text start="2884.059" dur="1">Magical Circle School and welcome to my segment</text><text start="2885.059" dur="1">titled Ask A Witch, where people may write
in and ask a question that I will answer to</text><text start="2886.059" dur="1">the best of</text><text start="2887.059" dur="1">my abilities.</text><text start="2888.059" dur="1">Today&amp;#39;s question comes from Belinda, who writes:</text><text start="2889.059" dur="1">What is the best way to send healing energy
at a distance to multiple loved ones with</text><text start="2890.059" dur="1">multiple</text><text start="2891.059" dur="1">diagnoses without wearing yourself out?</text><text start="2892.059" dur="1">Merry meet, Belinda. Well this can be tricky
depending on the type of healing you are choosing</text><text start="2893.059" dur="1">to</text><text start="2894.059" dur="1">do, the amount of people that you are trying
to heal, and how often you do it. One thing</text><text start="2895.059" dur="1">that I have</text><text start="2896.059" dur="1">learned is that a little goes a long way.
Typically, when I am sending out healing,</text><text start="2897.059" dur="1">I do it every</text><text start="2898.059" dur="1">morning at the same time. I keep a simple
healing altar set up in my kitchen on my windowsill</text><text start="2899.059" dur="1">and</text><text start="2900.059" dur="1">on it I have a candle that I light every morning
and a mug that I put the names of people I</text><text start="2901.059" dur="1">am</text><text start="2902.059" dur="1">sending out energy to. I think of each person
and see them in my mind&amp;#39;s eye as doing well.</text><text start="2903.059" dur="1">Then I</text><text start="2904.059" dur="1">go about my day. The key is to remember, you
aren&amp;#39;t going to cure them completely, but</text><text start="2905.059" dur="1">help the</text><text start="2906.059" dur="1">recovery along. Then every month, or whenever
I feel my energy has gotten low, I recharge</text><text start="2907.059" dur="1">it by</text><text start="2908.059" dur="1">doing a vinegar bath. I suggest listening
to the Protective Magick lecture in the Lecture</text><text start="2909.059" dur="1">Hall.</text><text start="2910.059" dur="1">Our next question comes from Andy Velez</text><text start="2911.059" dur="1">One aspect of my own journey that I would
like to work on is incorporating more physical</text><text start="2912.059" dur="1">activity</text><text start="2913.059" dur="1">and exercise. Is there a type of exercise
or physical activity that you particularly</text><text start="2914.059" dur="1">enjoy? Does this</text><text start="2915.059" dur="1">facilitate an opportunity for meditation or
other spiritual practices?</text><text start="2916.059" dur="1">Merry meet, Andy. Well I tend to struggle
when it comes to being active. I spend a lot</text><text start="2917.059" dur="1">of time at</text><text start="2918.059" dur="1">my computer desk and doing school work that
I tend to forget everything else that is going</text><text start="2919.059" dur="1">on</text><text start="2920.059" dur="1">around me. For a while I was doing well, got
a fitbit and started the Hungry Girl diet</text><text start="2921.059" dur="1">and started</text><text start="2922.059" dur="1">losing weight and inches. Then I went to the
doctor and my confidence was blown when I</text><text start="2923.059" dur="1">felt I</text><text start="2924.059" dur="1">was doing well and looking better and feeling
better. I told him I had a fit bit and he</text><text start="2925.059" dur="1">looked at me</text><text start="2926.059" dur="1">and said “Yeah, but are you using it?”
When I said I had to go out and buy a bunch</text><text start="2927.059" dur="1">of new clothes</text><text start="2928.059" dur="1">because I have lost 2 dress sizes he actually
chuckled. Needless to say I am in the market</text><text start="2929.059" dur="1">for a</text><text start="2930.059" dur="1">new doctor. But I digress, hopefully I will
get back on track again here soon. I am planning</text><text start="2931.059" dur="1">on</text><text start="2932.059" dur="1">restarting the diet, which is only a 4 week
diet, to re-kick start that. I have a treadmill</text><text start="2933.059" dur="1">that I was</text><text start="2934.059" dur="1">doing an hour walk on every day, plus every
hour my fit bit reminds me to do 250 steps,</text><text start="2935.059" dur="1">so I was</text><text start="2936.059" dur="1">averaging a little over 10,000 steps a day.
And then on top of that I was doing 45 minute</text><text start="2937.059" dur="1">work out</text><text start="2938.059" dur="1">dvds, I am really liking the Goddess Workout,
which is a belly dance work out video. There</text><text start="2939.059" dur="1">are 4</text><text start="2940.059" dur="1">dvds in the package and granted I have only
done the first one so far, but I enjoyed it.</text><text start="2941.059" dur="1">I also do</text><text start="2942.059" dur="1">meditate every day, I take some time for me
be it in the shower or before bed or in the</text><text start="2943.059" dur="1">morning</text><text start="2944.059" dur="1">when I am sending out healing energy to people,
I find that taking at least 5 minutes to connect</text><text start="2945.059" dur="1">spiritually helps me out a lot every day.</text><text start="2946.059" dur="1">Our third question comes from Andrew Ragan</text><text start="2947.059" dur="1">As I have been seeing there are different
ways to defeat illness. Which would you choose?</text><text start="2948.059" dur="1">Spells</text><text start="2949.059" dur="1">or homeopathic remedies, and how do you make
the determination which one would be more</text><text start="2950.059" dur="1">beneficial?</text><text start="2951.059" dur="1">Merry meet, Andrew. Well, it really depends
on the illness and what the doctors and medical</text><text start="2952.059" dur="1">professionals advise us to do. For the most
part, my view is that there is only so much</text><text start="2953.059" dur="1">we can do</text><text start="2954.059" dur="1">and only so much the professionals can do....however
if we work together maybe we can find a</text><text start="2955.059" dur="1">way to help things work better. It would be
nice if there was a spell or a herb that would</text><text start="2956.059" dur="1">completely cure us, but unfortunately the
reality is we can move towards feeling better,</text><text start="2957.059" dur="1">but</text><text start="2958.059" dur="1">illnesses and each person&amp;#39;s body&amp;#39;s chemistry
is different. What may work for one person</text><text start="2959.059" dur="1">may not</text><text start="2960.059" dur="1">work for another, what helps one person may
cause the opposite in another person. First</text><text start="2961.059" dur="1">and</text><text start="2962.059" dur="1">foremost, you should always talk to a medical
professional. They have the training and the</text><text start="2963.059" dur="1">understanding of the body and usually have
recommendations. Holistic medicine is a trial</text><text start="2964.059" dur="1">and error</text><text start="2965.059" dur="1">type of practice. Sometimes things can help
you along, sometimes things don&amp;#39;t work like</text><text start="2966.059" dur="1">you had</text><text start="2967.059" dur="1">hoped and some times what the medical professional
gives you will react poorly to a holistic</text><text start="2968.059" dur="1">add</text><text start="2969.059" dur="1">on, so always ask and talk to your doctors
about it and make sure that what you are doing</text><text start="2970.059" dur="1">to help</text><text start="2971.059" dur="1">the healing forward will not be preventing
the other medications to not perform correctly.</text><text start="2972.059" dur="1">However the first thing is to understand your
diagnosis, then understand what the traditional</text><text start="2973.059" dur="1">cure</text><text start="2974.059" dur="1">is, and then look up the different possible

questions!</text><text start="2983.059" dur="1">Merry Meet and welcome to the deity segment
for October, I’m Steven and this month we’ll</text><text start="2984.059" dur="1">be discussing a Voodoo loa named Legba (or
Papa Legba, to His followers). Mostly followed</text><text start="2985.059" dur="1">and evoked by the followers of Haitian and
New Orlean Voodoo, this God (or, Loa, as they’re</text><text start="2986.059" dur="1">referred to) is often viewed as an elderly
black man with a cane and straw hat, often</text><text start="2987.059" dur="1">he’s thought to sprinkle water upon the
ground or, alternately, smoking a pipe. He</text><text start="2988.059" dur="1">is often accompanied by a black dog or rooster
(which is an animal often given in offering</text><text start="2989.059" dur="1">of the Loa). Legba (often referred to as Legba
Ati-bon) is often the first and last spirit</text><text start="2990.059" dur="1">invoked within the Voodoo traditional rites
and rituals, this is because of His stance</text><text start="2991.059" dur="1">as the Gatekeeping Loa. He allows the passage
by loa from their world to this and, as such,</text><text start="2992.059" dur="1">is considered a very powerful God. His ability
to keep the crossroads makes Him a trickster</text><text start="2993.059" dur="1">by nature and, with this, comes the masterful
control He has over the languages of the human</text><text start="2994.059" dur="1">species. He can communicate with anyone He
chooses, supposedly, in any language He chooses</text><text start="2995.059" dur="1">to use. He speaks frequently with the other
loas and orders them to stay where He can</text><text start="2996.059" dur="1">watch them until they are given permission
to leave His company. This being said, it</text><text start="2997.059" dur="1">often leads people to be unable to contact
the Loa for any reason as they have angered</text><text start="2998.059" dur="1">Legba. Always bare-footed, Legba is in constant
contact with the Earth and, through this,</text><text start="2999.059" dur="1">He finds power. His symbol is the Sun and
He is a polite Loa, it is these manners and</text><text start="3000.059" dur="1">His further caring nature which earns Him
the title ‘Papa’, He is considered a much</text><text start="3001.059" dur="1">loved Loa. When Legba mounts someone (this
is the word used for the time when a Loa of</text><text start="3002.059" dur="1">Voodoo will be invoked into someone) they
are often said to experience great pain due</text><text start="3003.059" dur="1">to His twisted and crippled limbs. This Loa
should be honoured on November 1st, which</text><text start="3004.059" dur="1">is All Saints Day and can be offered a rooster,
or some part of it or, if this is something</text><text start="3005.059" dur="1">unavailable, some pipe tobacco would please
Him too. His colours are black, gold and rose,</text><text start="3006.059" dur="1">His day is Tuesday, and an offering of vegetables,
meats or mushrooms which have been grilled</text><text start="3007.059" dur="1">upon open flames or a barbecue should be given
in order to have Him open the portal to the</text><text start="3008.059" dur="1">other world.
My name is Steven, thank you for listening</text><text start="3009.059" dur="1">to the Deity segment for October. Merry Part.
Merry Meet and welcome to the Creature Feature</text><text start="3010.059" dur="1">for October, my name is Freyja Mahogany and
this month, we’re doing something a little</text><text start="3011.059" dur="1">different, I thought – since it’s Samhain
month and that also means Halloween, that</text><text start="3012.059" dur="1">we’d cover something altogether outside
of the norm.</text><text start="3013.059" dur="1">As we’re all aware, there are many different
poems and stories covering mystical and mythical</text><text start="3014.059" dur="1">creatures, lots of them somewhat eerie. I
thought hearing a few excerpts from some of</text><text start="3015.059" dur="1">my favourites might inspire some of you to
go out and write your own, do some research</text><text start="3016.059" dur="1">on what you hear or even just sit and enjoy
the tales for what they are.</text><text start="3017.059" dur="1">I realise this isn’t the standard layout
of the Creature Feature but I’m hoping you’ll</text><text start="3018.059" dur="1">enjoy it none-the-less.
We’ll start with an excerpt I remember well</text><text start="3019.059" dur="1">from my childhood in Scotland, from the late
Robert Burns’ tale “Tam O’ Shanter”.</text><text start="3020.059" dur="1">To set the scene, old Tam has had far too
much to drink and comes across this sight</text><text start="3021.059" dur="1">within Kirk Alloway, the excerpt begins as
Tam looks through one of the windows.</text><text start="3022.059" dur="1">“Warlocks and witches in a dance; 
Nae cotillion brent-new frae France, </text><text start="3023.059" dur="1">But hornpipes, jigs strathspeys, and reels, 
Put life and mettle in their heels. </text><text start="3024.059" dur="1">A winnock-bunker in the east, 
There sat auld Nick, in shape o&amp;#39; beast; </text><text start="3025.059" dur="1">A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, 
To gie them music was his charge: </text><text start="3026.059" dur="1">He scre&amp;#39;d the pipes and gart them skirl, 
Till roof and rafters a&amp;#39; did dirl.-- </text><text start="3027.059" dur="1">Coffins stood round, like open presses, 
That shaw&amp;#39;d the dead in their last dresses; </text><text start="3028.059" dur="1">And by some develish cantraip slight, 
Each in its cauld hand held a light.-- </text><text start="3029.059" dur="1">By which heroic Tam was able 
To note upon the haly table, </text><text start="3030.059" dur="1">A murders&amp;#39;s banes in gibbet-airns; 
Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen&amp;#39;d bairns; </text><text start="3031.059" dur="1">A thief, new-cutted frae a rape, 
Wi&amp;#39; his last gasp his gab did gape; </text><text start="3032.059" dur="1">Five tomahawks, wi blude red-rusted; 
Five scymitars, wi&amp;#39; murder crusted; </text><text start="3033.059" dur="1">A garter, which a babe had strangled; 
A knife, a father&amp;#39;s throat had mangled, </text><text start="3034.059" dur="1">Whom his ain son o&amp;#39; life bereft, 
The gray hairs yet stack to the heft;</text><text start="3035.059" dur="1">Wi&amp;#39; mair o&amp;#39; horrible and awfu&amp;#39;, 
Which even to name was be unlawfu&amp;#39;. </text><text start="3036.059" dur="1">Three lawyers&amp;#39; tongues, turn&amp;#39;d inside out, 
Wi&amp;#39; lies seam&amp;#39;d like a beggar&amp;#39;s clout; </text><text start="3037.059" dur="1">Three priests&amp;#39; hearts, rotten, black as muck, 
Lay stinking, vile in every neuk.</text><text start="3038.059" dur="1">As Tammie glowr&amp;#39;d, amaz&amp;#39;d, and curious, 
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious; </text><text start="3039.059" dur="1">The piper loud and louder blew; 
The dancers quick and quicker flew; </text><text start="3040.059" dur="1">They reel&amp;#39;d, they set, they cross&amp;#39;d, they
cleekit, </text><text start="3041.059" dur="1">Till ilka carlin swat and reekit, 
And coost her duddies to the wark,</text><text start="3042.059" dur="1">And linket at it in her sark!”
The next poem is something I’ve read again</text><text start="3043.059" dur="1">in childhood and it enchanted me then as much
as it does now. This is “Fairy Song” by</text><text start="3044.059" dur="1">Louisa May Alcott.
“The moonlight fades from flower and tree,</text><text start="3045.059" dur="1">    And the stars dim one by one;
    The tale is told, the song is sung,</text><text start="3046.059" dur="1">    And the Fairy feast is done.
    The night-wind rocks the sleeping</text><text start="3047.059" dur="1">flowers,
    And sings to them, soft and low.</text><text start="3048.059" dur="1">    The early birds erelong will wake:
    &amp;#39;T is time for the Elves to go.</text><text start="3049.059" dur="1">    O&amp;#39;er the sleeping earth we silently
pass,</text><text start="3050.059" dur="1">    Unseen by mortal eye,
    And send sweet dreams, as we lightly</text><text start="3051.059" dur="1">float
    Through the quiet moonlit sky;--</text><text start="3052.059" dur="1">    For the stars&amp;#39; soft eyes alone may
see,</text><text start="3053.059" dur="1">    And the flowers alone may know,
    The feasts we hold, the tales we tell:</text><text start="3054.059" dur="1">    So &amp;#39;t is time for the Elves to go.</text><text start="3055.059" dur="1">    From bird, and blossom, and bee,
    We learn the lessons they teach;</text><text start="3056.059" dur="1">    And seek, by kindly deeds, to win
    A loving friend in each.</text><text start="3057.059" dur="1">    And though unseen on earth we dwell,
    Sweet voices whisper low,</text><text start="3058.059" dur="1">    And gentle hearts most joyously greet
    The Elves where&amp;#39;er they go.</text><text start="3059.059" dur="1">    When next we meet in the Fairy dell,
    May the silver moon&amp;#39;s soft light</text><text start="3060.059" dur="1">    Shine then on faces gay as now,
    And Elfin hearts as light.</text><text start="3061.059" dur="1">    Now spread each wing, for the eastern
sky</text><text start="3062.059" dur="1">    With sunlight soon will glow.
    The morning star shall light us home:</text><text start="3063.059" dur="1">    Farewell! for the Elves must go. “
Next is something altogether more action-packed</text><text start="3064.059" dur="1">and reptilian. Siegfried Loraine Sassoon’s
“The Dragon and The Undying”.</text><text start="3065.059" dur="1">“  All night the flares go up; the Dragon
sings</text><text start="3066.059" dur="1">    And beats upon the dark with furious
wings;</text><text start="3067.059" dur="1">    And, stung to rage by his own darting
fires,</text><text start="3068.059" dur="1">    Reaches with grappling coils from
town to town;</text><text start="3069.059" dur="1">    He lusts to break the loveliness of
spires,</text><text start="3070.059" dur="1">    And hurls their martyred music toppling
down.</text><text start="3071.059" dur="1">    Yet, though the slain are homeless
as the breeze,</text><text start="3072.059" dur="1">    Vocal are they, like storm-bewilder&amp;#39;d
seas.</text><text start="3073.059" dur="1">    Their faces are the fair, unshrouded
night,</text><text start="3074.059" dur="1">    And planets are their eyes, their
ageless dreams.</text><text start="3075.059" dur="1">    Tenderly stooping earthward from their
height,</text><text start="3076.059" dur="1">    They wander in the dusk with chanting
streams;</text><text start="3077.059" dur="1">    And they are dawn-lit trees, with
arms up-flung,</text><text start="3078.059" dur="1">    To hail the burning heavens they left
unsung.</text><text start="3079.059" dur="1">I’m going to leave you today with words
spoken by the fairy Puck himself, from William</text><text start="3080.059" dur="1">Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”.
“If we shadows have offended,</text><text start="3081.059" dur="1">Think but this and all is mended,
That you have but slumber&amp;#39;d here</text><text start="3082.059" dur="1">While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,</text><text start="3083.059" dur="1">No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:</text><text start="3084.059" dur="1">If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,</text><text start="3085.059" dur="1">If we have unearnéd luck
Now to &amp;#39;scape the serpent&amp;#39;s tongue,</text><text start="3086.059" dur="1">We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call:</text><text start="3087.059" dur="1">So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,</text><text start="3088.059" dur="1">And Robin shall restore amends.”
I have been Freyja Mahogany, this has been</text><text start="3089.059" dur="1">your somewhat different Creature Feature for
the month of October. Thank you for listening,</text><text start="3090.059" dur="1">Merry Part and Trick or Treat!
Hi Guys, welcome to another segment of the</text><text start="3091.059" dur="1">Tarot Table. Today&amp;#39;s letter comes from Yonu.
Her</text><text start="3092.059" dur="1">mail reads:</text><text start="3093.059" dur="1">&amp;quot;Hi Lady Dainara,</text><text start="3094.059" dur="1">I have been told that I have an older female
that has passed over who watches over me and</text><text start="3095.059" dur="1">influences me. I would like to know more about
her. I&amp;#39;d like for you to use the Native American</text><text start="3096.059" dur="1">deck.</text><text start="3097.059" dur="1">Thank you,</text><text start="3098.059" dur="1">Yonu .&amp;quot;</text><text start="3099.059" dur="1">I hope I pronounced your name right. If not
I apologize! So I have the Native american</text><text start="3100.059" dur="1">deck out,</text><text start="3101.059" dur="1">let&amp;#39;s give that a quick shuffle....Ok Drawing
the first card we have the twins, which show</text><text start="3102.059" dur="1">a mother</text><text start="3103.059" dur="1">cradling a rabbit and watching over her adult
twin sons, Thunder and Lightning, as they</text><text start="3104.059" dur="1">play on</text><text start="3105.059" dur="1">the beach in the water and sand. The background
is a double sun with each shining its reflection</text><text start="3106.059" dur="1">on the water. There is somebody who views
themself as a mother figure watching out for</text><text start="3107.059" dur="1">y ou.</text><text start="3108.059" dur="1">Even though you are grown, as are these boys
and no longer need babying she is there to</text><text start="3109.059" dur="1">watch</text><text start="3110.059" dur="1">and whisper advice into your ear as you need
it. Notice she is cradling a rabbit. In many</text><text start="3111.059" dur="1">Native</text><text start="3112.059" dur="1">American lores the rabbit is a trickster which
encourages us to look before we leap and to</text><text start="3113.059" dur="1">carefully consider choices before action.
On the other end they are also symbolic of</text><text start="3114.059" dur="1">speed and</text><text start="3115.059" dur="1">enourage fast moment when it&amp;#39;s needed.</text><text start="3116.059" dur="1">Next card is the Willow. In this one we see
a Native American seated cross legged underneath</text><text start="3117.059" dur="1">a</text><text start="3118.059" dur="1">willow tree. He is dressed in traditional
robe and headdress and two decorated poles</text><text start="3119.059" dur="1">are erected.</text><text start="3120.059" dur="1">The tree&amp;#39;s branches are long and bear colorful
flowers which tells me maybe springtime or</text><text start="3121.059" dur="1">early</text><text start="3122.059" dur="1">summer. There is a circle of stones built
around the area and a hint of a bubbling brook</text><text start="3123.059" dur="1">nearby.</text><text start="3124.059" dur="1">The willow tree is a very useful tree not
only does it provide a little bit of shelter</text><text start="3125.059" dur="1">and a sense of</text><text start="3126.059" dur="1">security but it can be made into medicines
and useful products as well. That is what</text><text start="3127.059" dur="1">the woman</text><text start="3128.059" dur="1">hanging about you is serving as, in a spiritual
sense, as you look for and find your path</text><text start="3129.059" dur="1">or seek</text><text start="3130.059" dur="1">your answers.</text><text start="3131.059" dur="1">The next card I draw is water. It shows a
image of a woman up to her eyes watching the</text><text start="3132.059" dur="1">waterbug. In the background we see sea lions
resting on ice. Water is very symbolic of</text><text start="3133.059" dur="1">emotion. It</text><text start="3134.059" dur="1">also is a symbol of the hidden and unseen.
The sea lion in many native american cultures</text><text start="3135.059" dur="1">represent not only protection from danger
but lucid dreaming and messages. Do you dream</text><text start="3136.059" dur="1">of this</text><text start="3137.059" dur="1">woman or get any kind of advice in your sleep?
I would start paying attention to those dreams</text><text start="3138.059" dur="1">if</text><text start="3139.059" dur="1">you do.</text><text start="3140.059" dur="1">Finally I&amp;#39;ve drawn turkey. Here we see some
native americans dancing around a turkey with</text><text start="3141.059" dur="1">debris, feather and stones all up in the air.
His eyes are closed while the Native americans</text><text start="3142.059" dur="1">look</text><text start="3143.059" dur="1">joyful and celebratory. NAtive Americans took
birds of all types as messengers of the Great</text><text start="3144.059" dur="1">Spirit</text><text start="3145.059" dur="1">and when they appeared they have something
to teach. The Turkey specifically also represented</text><text start="3146.059" dur="1">nourishment, leadership and strength.</text><text start="3147.059" dur="1">So recapping, You wanted to know about a woman
that people say is around you. The cards</text><text start="3148.059" dur="1">didn&amp;#39;t tell me so much about her as they did
about the purpose she has in your life right</text><text start="3149.059" dur="1">now. She</text><text start="3150.059" dur="1">is most likely an ancestor or at least someone
who has taken on a motherly role for you in</text><text start="3151.059" dur="1">teaching, guiding, protecting and helping
you find your way down your path in a healthy</text><text start="3152.059" dur="1">way. She</text><text start="3153.059" dur="1">remains very hidden but she is there and celebrates
with joy when you make good choices and</text><text start="3154.059" dur="1">show the leadership qualities you were meant
to have and when you need her she is there</text><text start="3155.059" dur="1">at your</text><text start="3156.059" dur="1">back to give you strength.</text><text start="3157.059" dur="1">God bless, Yonu.
Merry Meet, Freyja here with your Reading</text><text start="3158.059" dur="1">the Numbers segment. This month we’ll be
looking at the numbers of Destynee Myshelle</text><text start="3159.059" dur="1">Worthen.
Destynee, your Life Path number is 6. The</text><text start="3160.059" dur="1">Life Path of 8 is reserved for those with
practical, down-to-Earth wants in life. It</text><text start="3161.059" dur="1">is the number of material gain and the urge
to be fulfilled financially whatever the cost,</text><text start="3162.059" dur="1">you will be frugal and careful with money
until the urge takes you, when you’ll flourish</text><text start="3163.059" dur="1">into a spending frenzy. You will often compare
your material wealth to that of those around</text><text start="3164.059" dur="1">you and feel down if you do not find your
wealth exceeding theirs. Ambitious and self-confident,</text><text start="3165.059" dur="1">you have a natural want to lead the group,
rather than follow and, whilst this I often</text><text start="3166.059" dur="1">a great characteristic that one should be
proud of, it can often lead you into trouble</text><text start="3167.059" dur="1">with your boss or team leaders. You are capable,
organised, and inspirational which should</text><text start="3168.059" dur="1">aid you in getting to the top of the ladder.
Rigidity and stubbornness run in your veins</text><text start="3169.059" dur="1">making you a difficult person to work with,
and your inability to see other ways to do</text><text start="3170.059" dur="1">things only add to this issue. You will attract
financial success more than any other number</text><text start="3171.059" dur="1">and, while this is a positive, it will often
come at the cost of your friendships, familial</text><text start="3172.059" dur="1">relationships and the health and wellbeing
of others. You are ruthless in your goal-orientation</text><text start="3173.059" dur="1">and will find great satisfaction in reaching
your accumulative goals. Politics and social</text><text start="3174.059" dur="1">work would be good career paths for you, as
would something in the judicial system. Most</text><text start="3175.059" dur="1">eights (like you) have a tendency to keep
others dependant upon them for longer than</text><text start="3176.059" dur="1">is completely necessary. You can find yourself
becoming isolated, seeking conflict and unable</text><text start="3177.059" dur="1">to communicate effectively, this is due to
the domineering nature of your character.</text><text start="3178.059" dur="1">Don’t blame yourself for your faults though,
these are often as a result of your upbringing,</text><text start="3179.059" dur="1">by someone abusive, whether within the family
or outwith. Your expression number is nine,</text><text start="3180.059" dur="1">this shows that you are artistic, personable,
and a calming influence on those around you.</text><text start="3181.059" dur="1">You are a person who seeks balance and diplomacy
in all situations; this is something that</text><text start="3182.059" dur="1">people can see about you and will often latch
onto this as something they like about you;</text><text start="3183.059" dur="1">it can lead you into lots of different friendships
with lots of different people. This number</text><text start="3184.059" dur="1">also reveals that you are an artistic person,
this is something you will find is a relaxant</text><text start="3185.059" dur="1">in your life. You must be wary of people trying
to throw off your balance with mean words</text><text start="3186.059" dur="1">or energy sapping; this is something that
will happen often when people realise that</text><text start="3187.059" dur="1">you are such a pool of calming energy. You
can protect yourself in many ways, one of</text><text start="3188.059" dur="1">the best for a two like you, is that of speaking
to those you love and hold dear, you should</text><text start="3189.059" dur="1">ensure that your friends are people who want
only the best for you and, though it can be</text><text start="3190.059" dur="1">difficult to let go of those people who drag
you down this is really the best course of</text><text start="3191.059" dur="1">action. You are open-minded and willing to
get in there, get mucky, and try it out; even</text><text start="3192.059" dur="1">if it doesn’t always conclude in success,
this doesn’t often get you down though;</text><text start="3193.059" dur="1">you tend to look upon your failures as an
adventure into education, rather than a misguided</text><text start="3194.059" dur="1">attempt at something. This serves you so well
as you gather knowledge and store it from</text><text start="3195.059" dur="1">each and every experience you have. Your love
and need for calm and tranquil settings in</text><text start="3196.059" dur="1">your life can often lead to an issue in one
area of your life, though… Parenting, where</text><text start="3197.059" dur="1">the firm hand is sometimes the best approach.
This is not to say that you’re a bad parent,</text><text start="3198.059" dur="1">more that you need time to adjust to the idea
that putting your foot down is something that</text><text start="3199.059" dur="1">is essential in the parenting world. With
a good sense of rhythm and great musical talent,</text><text start="3200.059" dur="1">you possess all the skills necessary for a
great musical career, though you probably</text><text start="3201.059" dur="1">won’t pursue it for fear of rejection. Your
Soul Urge is five, this is a number of travel,</text><text start="3202.059" dur="1">new experiences and change. You like far-off
places and adventures, nothing makes you happier</text><text start="3203.059" dur="1">than running free, able to do as you please.
You can adapt to meet the requirements of</text><text start="3204.059" dur="1">any situation life throws at you and are extremely
inquisitive. You are a wordsmith and would</text><text start="3205.059" dur="1">probably do well in studying languages. Imagination
is another of your strong points. With high</text><text start="3206.059" dur="1">levels of resourcefulness, cat-like reflexes
and a clear head on your shoulders you are</text><text start="3207.059" dur="1">a great person to have around in a crisis.
If an apocalypse happened tomorrow, you’d</text><text start="3208.059" dur="1">be everyone’s first choice as a survival
buddy – feeling enjoyment at being a hero</text><text start="3209.059" dur="1">you would thrive in this situation. You flourish
in social situations where your quirky nature</text><text start="3210.059" dur="1">draws people to you who are original thinkers,
like you. You need constant stimulation and</text><text start="3211.059" dur="1">will rid yourself of any hobbies you are bored
of. Be cautious of addictions, Destynee,</text><text start="3212.059" dur="1">your sensory pleasure lights up at all the
‘bad things’ in life, ensure that your</text><text start="3213.059" dur="1">love of gambling doesn’t turn into a problem.
You have a tendency to over-promise and be</text><text start="3214.059" dur="1">irresponsible, be sure to finish tasks and
not worry about pleasing everyone – it’s</text><text start="3215.059" dur="1">never going to happen. Emotionally you are
passionate but commitment-phobic (highly unsurprising</text><text start="3216.059" dur="1">for a lover of freedom and change). Your
personal growth will come from many changes</text><text start="3217.059" dur="1">in your life where you’ll learn practically
and thrive in the variety.  Your birthday</text><text start="3218.059" dur="1">number is eleven, this shows that you are
intuitive and would make a good counsellor</text><text start="3219.059" dur="1">or healer. You have a general appreciation
of what makes people tick, an insight into</text><text start="3220.059" dur="1">the way the world works and what it is that
motivates the world to operate the way it</text><text start="3221.059" dur="1">does. Your ego becomes bruised very easily
and, though you hate to admit it, this takes</text><text start="3222.059" dur="1">you time to recover from. You can inspire
people and have an energy that excites other</text><text start="3223.059" dur="1">people, your ideas tend to revolve around
making the world a Utopian paradise, this</text><text start="3224.059" dur="1">is something that a lot of people appreciate
within you. You do not become stranded in</text><text start="3225.059" dur="1">the things which cause problems to other people,
nor do you become involved in the problems</text><text start="3226.059" dur="1">themselves, though you will guide and give
advice from a distance you see as fitting.</text><text start="3227.059" dur="1">Your nervous system is something which affects
you deeply, you should maintain a proper balanced</text><text start="3228.059" dur="1">diet to help with extracting this from your
body. You, ultimately, seek to make the world</text><text start="3229.059" dur="1">a better place.

segment with Jenie Piccirillo. She is the</text><text start="3250.059" dur="1">teacher of</text><text start="3251.059" dur="1">Lycanthropy, The Vampires 1 and 2, and The
Unexplained and Interesting.</text><text start="3252.059" dur="1">Hi Jenie!</text><text start="3253.059" dur="1">Hi Dannielle!</text><text start="3254.059" dur="1">So, let&amp;#39;s see, we&amp;#39;re going to profile a couple
different kinds of classes, although they</text><text start="3255.059" dur="1">have sort of a</text><text start="3256.059" dur="1">common thread or theme which is very exciting.
Especially with the month of October upon</text><text start="3257.059" dur="1">us.</text><text start="3258.059" dur="1">Yeah</text><text start="3259.059" dur="1">You can talk about the classes in any order
that you like. So, I am going to start of</text><text start="3260.059" dur="1">with what is the</text><text start="3261.059" dur="1">theme of these classes? What are your classes
about?</text><text start="3262.059" dur="1">Well, the Lycanthropy is the basic beginnings
on werewolves.</text><text start="3263.059" dur="1">Okay</text><text start="3264.059" dur="1">and it goes a little bit into the origins
and how it was believed that people became</text><text start="3265.059" dur="1">werewolves, it</text><text start="3266.059" dur="1">goes into case studies and counter claims,
and how to protect yourself to avoid becoming</text><text start="3267.059" dur="1">one or</text><text start="3268.059" dur="1">how to avoid changing if you did get bitten.</text><text start="3269.059" dur="1">Oh wow.</text><text start="3270.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3271.059" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s very cool!</text><text start="3272.059" dur="1">Alright! Well, that is an important aspect,
I would suppose. Especially with the mythology</text><text start="3273.059" dur="1">of it,</text><text start="3274.059" dur="1">you know?</text><text start="3275.059" dur="1">Yes!</text><text start="3276.059" dur="1">So, what&amp;#39;s next?</text><text start="3277.059" dur="1">The Vampire class goes over the different
types of vampires, and it breaks them down</text><text start="3278.059" dur="1">from culture</text><text start="3279.059" dur="1">to culture. Yeah, and it goes over the people
that have done very bad things. So bad that</text><text start="3280.059" dur="1">they were</text><text start="3281.059" dur="1">given the title of Vampire.</text><text start="3282.059" dur="1">Oh, okay...so like criminal</text><text start="3283.059" dur="1">Yes! There is Vlad the Impaler, Elizabeth
Bathory... Bathory wasn&amp;#39;t actually a blood-sucking</text><text start="3284.059" dur="1">vampire, but she did some pretty gruesome
stuff that earned her the title.</text><text start="3285.059" dur="1">Okay..Oh wow.</text><text start="3286.059" dur="1">What about the Unexplained and Interesting?</text><text start="3287.059" dur="1">Well, the Unexplained and Interesting is a
really fun class that are about things that</text><text start="3288.059" dur="1">happened that</text><text start="3289.059" dur="1">we don&amp;#39;t have an answer to, yet. Like the
ringing rocks in the northeast. What makes</text><text start="3290.059" dur="1">them ring?</text><text start="3291.059" dur="1">And, ball lightning, how does that happen?</text><text start="3292.059" dur="1">Right.</text><text start="3293.059" dur="1">Then there is the case of the Devil&amp;#39;s Footprint,
where clawed footprints where all over the</text><text start="3294.059" dur="1">snow,</text><text start="3295.059" dur="1">and nobody knows how.</text><text start="3296.059" dur="1">Oh wow.</text><text start="3297.059" dur="1">They wonder what kind of creature did it!</text><text start="3298.059" dur="1">Right? Exactly, exactly.</text><text start="3299.059" dur="1">Do you cover and mythological creatures that
are of known origins?</text><text start="3300.059" dur="1">Yeah, there&amp;#39;s sea monsters, the Jersey Devil,
Bigfoot. Different types of Bigfoots and how</text><text start="3301.059" dur="1">they</text><text start="3302.059" dur="1">differ from culture to culture.</text><text start="3303.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3304.059" dur="1">My son loves the Bigfoot programs on tv. And,
every time we go out...we live right here</text><text start="3305.059" dur="1">at the</text><text start="3306.059" dur="1">woods, so he is...they are always looking
for “squatches”</text><text start="3307.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3308.059" dur="1">I think it&amp;#39;s hysterical, because I always
ask them what they are going to do if they</text><text start="3309.059" dur="1">find one.</text><text start="3310.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3311.059" dur="1">Probably have an accident and run</text><text start="3312.059" dur="1">That is exactly right.</text><text start="3313.059" dur="1">Now, are there any requirements for taking
any of these classes?</text><text start="3314.059" dur="1">No. You just need your Hall Pass for each
of them.</text><text start="3315.059" dur="1">So, you can get right in there, as soon as
you&amp;#39;re done with the EE.</text><text start="3316.059" dur="1">Pretty much, yeah.</text><text start="3317.059" dur="1">How exciting, &amp;#39;cause those sound like FUN
classes. I mean, I love the mythology of those</text><text start="3318.059" dur="1">things,</text><text start="3319.059" dur="1">and</text><text start="3320.059" dur="1">this time of the year you kind of think about
those a little bit more, anyway. You know?</text><text start="3321.059" dur="1">Yeah, and all the programs that are coming
on tv help with that too!</text><text start="3322.059" dur="1">Oh, absolutely. One episode of Scooby Doo
and I&amp;#39;m stuck!</text><text start="3323.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3324.059" dur="1">Now, how long are the classes?</text><text start="3325.059" dur="1">The werewolf class is pretty short. If you
put your nose to the grind and really buckle</text><text start="3326.059" dur="1">down, it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3327.059" dur="1">probably about a day.</text><text start="3328.059" dur="1">Oh my goodness...</text><text start="3329.059" dur="1">Yeah, it&amp;#39;s really short.</text><text start="3330.059" dur="1">So, when you say a day...it will take me,
what a month?</text><text start="3331.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3332.059" dur="1">Maybe two days, for you.</text><text start="3333.059" dur="1">Oh, look at you. Maybe I should get that one
in there.</text><text start="3334.059" dur="1">Now what about the Vampire class?</text><text start="3335.059" dur="1">The Vampire class is a pretty long one. And,
that&amp;#39;s actually why I broke it up into two</text><text start="3336.059" dur="1">classes. It</text><text start="3337.059" dur="1">used to be one class twenty lessons long.</text><text start="3338.059" dur="1">Oh wow</text><text start="3339.059" dur="1">I think that many people were getting frustrated
in it, and quitting at the halfway point.</text><text start="3340.059" dur="1">So, I broke</text><text start="3341.059" dur="1">it into two classes. So they could take one,
take a break and go take something else. And</text><text start="3342.059" dur="1">then</text><text start="3343.059" dur="1">they could come back to the second class,
if they want to. There is a lot of paper writing</text><text start="3344.059" dur="1">in that</text><text start="3345.059" dur="1">one.</text><text start="3346.059" dur="1">Oh, alright</text><text start="3347.059" dur="1">and the subjects are so obscure, that it really
takes some digging and researching</text><text start="3348.059" dur="1">Oh, yeah. I can imagine.</text><text start="3349.059" dur="1">I know that can get exhausting.</text><text start="3350.059" dur="1">It can be, especially if you can&amp;#39;t find a
resource that you are looking for.</text><text start="3351.059" dur="1">Right</text><text start="3352.059" dur="1">...sometimes in this one, you have to actually
crack open a book and not just rely on websites.</text><text start="3353.059" dur="1">Oh, I&amp;#39;m a book person myself, anyway. I like
that primarily. Like it backs up the stuff</text><text start="3354.059" dur="1">that I find on</text><text start="3355.059" dur="1">the internet, ya know?</text><text start="3356.059" dur="1">Right</text><text start="3357.059" dur="1">What about the Unexplained and Interesting?</text><text start="3358.059" dur="1">That one is an average class</text><text start="3359.059" dur="1">Okay</text><text start="3360.059" dur="1">Probably about as long as the Correspondence
classes or any other average class that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3361.059" dur="1">there.</text><text start="3362.059" dur="1">Okay. Alright</text><text start="3363.059" dur="1">about 10 lessons</text><text start="3364.059" dur="1">oh wow</text><text start="3365.059" dur="1">Any projects or mostly writing?</text><text start="3366.059" dur="1">In the Vampire class, there are a couple of
projects. You are making ...for one you are</text><text start="3367.059" dur="1">making</text><text start="3368.059" dur="1">vampire wings, which actually one person made
them for her daughter t wear for trick or</text><text start="3369.059" dur="1">treating</text><text start="3370.059" dur="1">two years ago.</text><text start="3371.059" dur="1">Oh how awesome is that? What a great idea.</text><text start="3372.059" dur="1">Yeah. And, at the end you are making a trash
can vampire. Not a trash can...a trash bag</text><text start="3373.059" dur="1">vampire.</text><text start="3374.059" dur="1">Oh very cool. I was gonna say, I was thinking
of Oscar the Grouch as soon as you said that.</text><text start="3375.059" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3376.059" dur="1">What do you think the most difficult assignments
are? For any of those classes?</text><text start="3377.059" dur="1">For the Vampires, it&amp;#39;s the paper writing.</text><text start="3378.059" dur="1">Yeah?</text><text start="3379.059" dur="1">As I said previously, some of them are pretty
hard to find so I would say, just do your</text><text start="3380.059" dur="1">best.</text><text start="3381.059" dur="1">Okay, what about the Lycan class?</text><text start="3382.059" dur="1">In the Lycans, people have said that they
have had problems with some of the case scenarios</text><text start="3383.059" dur="1">Okay</text><text start="3384.059" dur="1">That is where there is four cases that I ask
you to read and I want you to tell me your</text><text start="3385.059" dur="1">opinion.</text><text start="3386.059" dur="1">What do you think? Could this be true? Do
you think it&amp;#39;s a hoax? And, these cases are</text><text start="3387.059" dur="1">so good, that</text><text start="3388.059" dur="1">it really is hard to tell, I have gotten a
variety of opinions.</text><text start="3389.059" dur="1">Oh, wow. Well that sounds cool.</text><text start="3390.059" dur="1">That sounds ... I love shows like that, where
they profile something and you have to decide</text><text start="3391.059" dur="1">if it</text><text start="3392.059" dur="1">was a fact based thing or a total hoax. That&amp;#39;s
wonderful</text><text start="3393.059" dur="1">I got the idea from that tv show, Fact or
Fiction.</text><text start="3394.059" dur="1">Oh, I love that show, I would love this class
I think.</text><text start="3395.059" dur="1">What about the Unexplained and Interesting?
Any real difficult assignments in there?</text><text start="3396.059" dur="1">No, there is some paper writing. But, it&amp;#39;s
not real hard.</text><text start="3397.059" dur="1">Oh okay.</text><text start="3398.059" dur="1">It&amp;#39;s probably the same as researching a gemstone
and writing about it.</text><text start="3399.059" dur="1">Uh oh, well, come on now.... some of us are
challenged on their research stuff</text><text start="3400.059" dur="1">Okay, what do you think are the easiest assignments
in these classes?</text><text start="3401.059" dur="2.141">In the Vampire classes there are a couple
movie watching assignments.</text><text start="3403.2" dur="1">Ooooo</text><text start="3404.2" dur="5.81">Yeah there are a few movies that I have my
students watch, and there are a few puzzles.</text><text start="3410.01" dur="2.059">They are</text><text start="3412.069" dur="5.45">basically unscramble puzzles. The reason that
I did that was to give people a break from</text><text start="3417.519" dur="1">the</text><text start="3418.519" dur="1">research.</text><text start="3419.519" dur="5.33">Oh that&amp;#39;s great though. I think you are kind
of known for that. Even your online rituals,</text><text start="3424.849" dur="1">when you</text><text start="3425.849" dur="4.41">are doing the full moon and stuff, those are
a lot of FUN. I love how you throw in a craft</text><text start="3430.259" dur="1">or an art</text><text start="3431.259" dur="2.181">project in. That&amp;#39;s a lot of fun!</text><text start="3433.44" dur="1.19">**Laughter</text><text start="3434.63" dur="9.31">Okay, so...let&amp;#39;s see. What do you think is
in these classes that can help someone on</text><text start="3443.94" dur="1">their personal</text><text start="3444.94" dur="1.79">path, or maybe in everyday practices?</text><text start="3446.73" dur="8.269">I originally wrote them to be a fun elective,
to take a break from the big serious classes.</text><text start="3454.999" dur="1.12">But, even</text><text start="3456.119" dur="4.831">still, I think it is important to know what
is out there and what people throughout history</text><text start="3460.95" dur="1">have</text><text start="3461.95" dur="1">believed.</text><text start="3462.95" dur="1.73">Oh that is great point, and it sounds like
fun. I could use a break, ya know?</text><text start="3464.68" dur="1">**Laughter</text><text start="3465.68" dur="5.33">I have been in a lot of paper writing classes
lately, I&amp;#39;ll say!</text><text start="3471.01" dur="1">I would love to get into one of these. Let
me hurry up and get done with one of these</text><text start="3472.01" dur="1">classes, so I</text><text start="3473.01" dur="1">can jump in!</text><text start="3474.01" dur="4.609">Now do you think that there is anything that
surprises your students in this classes? Or</text><text start="3478.619" dur="1">any of these</text><text start="3479.619" dur="1">classes? Do you have any special tips?</text><text start="3480.619" dur="7.72">Not that I have been told so far. I don&amp;#39;t
really have any special tips, just have FUN.</text><text start="3488.339" dur="1.49">Very very good.</text><text start="3489.829" dur="8.75">Well, Jenie. I am so glad that discussed these
four classes. I think that you mentioned,</text><text start="3498.579" dur="1.351">not on here</text><text start="3499.93" dur="7.409">but earlier, that you are writing another
class that is sort of in this category. What</text><text start="3507.339" dur="1.22">is that, that</text><text start="3508.559" dur="1">you&amp;#39;re writing?</text><text start="3509.559" dur="2.621">That&amp;#39;s actually... I have the Angel series.
One, two, and three.</text><text start="3512.18" dur="1">Uh huh</text><text start="3513.18" dur="4.71">And, I am in the process, I am almost done
now, actually. I&amp;#39;m in the process of writing</text><text start="3517.89" dur="1">a fourth</text><text start="3518.89" dur="1.52">one, that covers the Fallen.</text><text start="3520.41" dur="1">Oh.</text><text start="3521.41" dur="6.459">They are demons and nasty creatures, but what
is a demon other than a fallen angel?</text><text start="3527.869" dur="1">Okay</text><text start="3528.869" dur="8">So, I figured they would fit in there, if
you want to look at the lefter side of the</text><text start="3536.869" dur="1">spectrum.</text><text start="3537.869" dur="9.061">Yes!Exactly. Well, there is a lot of mythology.
And then there are a lot of experience based</text><text start="3546.93" dur="4.99">things... people say, oh I work with this
and I do that. I talk to this person, or I</text><text start="3551.92" dur="1.01">use this thing or</text><text start="3552.93" dur="4.06">entity. I think that would be interesting
to know, just more facts.</text><text start="3556.99" dur="1">Right</text><text start="3557.99" dur="2.599">Actually get in there and dig a little bit.</text><text start="3560.589" dur="4.101">That sounds like an excellent class. You should
...that is class number four in the Angel</text><text start="3564.69" dur="1">series.</text><text start="3565.69" dur="6.72">Yes, it is a little different than the other
three, because I have you actually contacting</text><text start="3572.41" dur="1">and working</text><text start="3573.41" dur="6.67">with these angels. And, in the fourth class
it is more of a research and information.</text><text start="3580.08" dur="1.6">I don&amp;#39;t want to</text><text start="3581.68" dur="2.56">force anyone to work with the dark, if they
don&amp;#39;t want to.</text><text start="3584.24" dur="3.43">Well, that is interesting. And, thank you.</text><text start="3587.67" dur="1">**laughter</text><text start="3588.67" dur="5.409">for not making that part of it, but that is
just a personal thing... everyone might be</text><text start="3594.079" dur="1.02">excited about it</text><text start="3595.099" dur="1">Right</text><text start="3596.099" dur="3.361">That sounds excellent. Can&amp;#39;t wait to see that
one jump up n the class list, as well.</text><text start="3599.46" dur="5">Well, thank you Jenie! I am so excited that
you came and talked to me today about all</text><text start="3604.46" dur="1.02">of these. I</text><text start="3605.48" dur="5.44">think that getting in there and taking the
werewolf class... Lycan – thropy?</text><text start="3610.92" dur="1">Yep</text><text start="3611.92" dur="6.06">Lycanthropy class...why is that such a hard
word for me to say? Study the Lycans, is that</text><text start="3617.98" dur="1">right?</text><text start="3618.98" dur="1.48">No? Maybe?</text><text start="3620.46" dur="4.869">Right...Lycanthropy is just the werewolf part
of it. There is Therianthropy like other creatures:</text><text start="3625.329" dur="1.661">werefoxes, werecats, werebears...</text><text start="3626.99" dur="6.119">Oh my goodness, that&amp;#39;s a real thing? I didn&amp;#39;t
even know.</text><text start="3633.109" dur="1">Yeah</text><text start="3634.109" dur="4.311">I remember that movie, Wallace and Grommit
– The Curse of the Wererabbit. And I thought</text><text start="3638.42" dur="1">that</text><text start="3639.42" dur="7.26">was the coolest little movie. Of course, I
like that kind of thing. I didn&amp;#39;t realize</text><text start="3646.68" dur="3.24">there were Were-
other things... that&amp;#39;s kind of cool.</text><text start="3649.92" dur="2.06">Yes. The wolf is just one.</text><text start="3651.98" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s the one you hear about</text><text start="3652.98" dur="1.23">yep, the most popular one</text><text start="3654.21" dur="7.279">Well, that sounds wonderful. I can&amp;#39;t wait
to investigate a little further. So anybody</text><text start="3661.489" dur="1">who is</text><text start="3662.489" dur="4.541">interested in this kind of class, contact
