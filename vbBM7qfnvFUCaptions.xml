mathematics</text><text start="115.759" dur="6.99">and chemistry are sciences.</text><text start="122.749" dur="6.921">But still it is a science because it is the
ultimate knowing: the</text><text start="129.67" dur="3.69">word science means knowing.</text><text start="133.36" dur="9.11">And if religion is not a science, what else
can be?</text><text start="142.47" dur="7.099">It is the
highest knowing, it is the purest knowing.</text><text start="149.569" dur="13.361">Ordinary science is knowledge, not knowing:
religion is knowing itself.</text><text start="162.93" dur="9.809">Ordinary science
is object-oriented -- it knows something,</text><text start="172.739" dur="3.92">hence it is knowledge.</text><text start="176.659" dur="10.981">Religion is not objectoriented;
it has no object, it knows nothing.</text><text start="187.64" dur="9.469">Knowing knows itself, as if the mirror is
reflecting itself.</text><text start="197.109" dur="5.27">It is utterly pure of all content.</text><text start="202.379" dur="7.741">Hence religion is not knowledge but
knowing.</text><text start="210.12" dur="7.729">Science is a lower kind of knowing, religion
is a higher kind.</text><text start="217.849" dur="4.381">Religion is PHILOSOPHIA
ULTIMA: the ultimate knowing.</text><text start="222.23" dur="11.02">The difference between the two is not of the
spirit -- the</text><text start="233.25" dur="8.519">spirit is the same -- but the difference is
certainly of purity.</text><text start="241.769" dur="11.271">Science is mixed with much mud.</text><text start="253.04" dur="8.38">Religion is pure essence, pure fragrance.</text><text start="261.42" dur="8.47">The mud has
disappeared, the lotus has appeared.</text><text start="269.89" dur="10.11">And at the ultimate stage even the lotus has
disappeared, only the fragrance abides.</text><text start="280" dur="5.64">These are the three stages of knowing: the
mud,</text><text start="285.64" dur="8.75">the lotus and the fragrance.</text><text start="294.39" dur="9.22">Religion cannot be grasped, because there
is no object in it.</text><text start="303.61" dur="8.98">But still it can be understood.</text><text start="312.59" dur="9.33">It cannot be explained, but it can be experienced.</text><text start="321.92" dur="13.58">There is no way of informing you about
religion, because it cannot be reduced to</text><text start="335.5" dur="4.04">information.</text><text start="339.54" dur="9.58">But you can be shown the way, the
path to it -- fingers pointing to the moon.</text><text start="349.12" dur="6.41">The fingers are not the moon, obviously, but
the</text><text start="355.53" dur="5.69">fingers can point to the moon.</text><text start="361.22" dur="11.69">These &amp;quot;Seven Points of Mind Training&amp;quot; of the
great master Atisha, are fingers, seven</text><text start="372.91" dur="6.42">fingers pointing to the moon.</text><text start="379.33" dur="6.22">Don&amp;#39;t be caught by the fingers, don&amp;#39;t become
too much</text><text start="385.55" dur="3.13">obsessed with the fingers.</text><text start="388.68" dur="6.91">That is not the point, that will be missing
the point.</text><text start="395.59" dur="5.31">Use the
fingers and forget them, and look where the</text><text start="400.9" dur="5.4">fingers are pointing.</text><text start="406.3" dur="6.23">And when you see the
moon, who bothers about the fingers?</text><text start="412.53" dur="6.49">Who remembers them?</text><text start="419.02" dur="10.41">They automatically
become nonessential; they disappear.</text><text start="429.43" dur="9.4">That&amp;#39;s why for those who have experienced
religion, all the scriptures become utterly</text><text start="438.83" dur="10.99">useless, all methods become nonessential.</text><text start="449.82" dur="9.86">When the goal is achieved, the path is
forgotten.</text><text start="459.68" dur="12.6">Atisha is one of the rare masters, rare in
the sense that he was taught by three enlightened</text><text start="472.28" dur="2.3">masters.</text><text start="474.58" dur="6.59">It has never happened before, and never since.</text><text start="481.17" dur="8.6">To be a disciple of three
enlightened masters </text><text start="489.77" dur="13.98">is simply unbelievable -- because one enlightened
master is enough.</text><text start="503.75" dur="9.079">But this story, that he was taught by three
enlightened masters, has a metaphorical</text><text start="512.829" dur="1.801">significance also.</text><text start="514.63" dur="6.37">And it is true, it is historical too.</text><text start="521" dur="17.83">The three masters that Atisha remained with
for many years were: first, Dharmakirti, a</text><text start="538.83" dur="4.73">great Buddhist mystic.</text><text start="543.56" dur="11.97">He taught him no-mind, he taught him emptiness,
he taught him</text><text start="555.53" dur="11.53">how to be thoughtless, he taught him how to
drop all content from the mind and be</text><text start="567.06" dur="4.27">contentless.</text><text start="571.33" dur="10.11">The second master was Dharmarakshita, another
Buddhist mystic.</text><text start="581.44" dur="8">He taught
him love, compassion.</text><text start="589.44" dur="7.17">And the third master was Yogin Maitreya, another
Buddhist</text><text start="596.61" dur="3.76">mystic.</text><text start="600.37" dur="8.68">He taught him the art of taking the suffering
of others and absorbing it into your</text><text start="609.05" dur="9.92">own heart: love in action.</text><text start="618.97" dur="12.3">This could happen because all these three
masters were great friends.</text><text start="631.27" dur="8.92">They had started
their search together; while they were on</text><text start="640.19" dur="13.27">the way they had remained together, and when
they attained they were still together.</text><text start="653.46" dur="5.45">Atisha became a disciple of Dharmakirti.</text><text start="658.91" dur="4.28">Dharmakirti said to him, &amp;quot;I will teach you
the</text><text start="663.19" dur="4.45">first principle.</text><text start="667.64" dur="6.2">And for the second you go to Dharmarakshita,
and for the third to Yogin</text><text start="673.84" dur="4.06">Maitreya.</text><text start="677.9" dur="10.04">This way you will know all the three faces
of the ultimate reality, the three</text><text start="687.94" dur="9.18">faces of God -- the trinity, the TRIMURTI.</text><text start="697.12" dur="15.51">And this way you will learn each face from
the person who is the most perfect in it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="712.63" dur="4.69">These are the three ways people reach to the
ultimate.</text><text start="717.32" dur="12.45">If you reach through emptiness you
attain the other two also, but your path remains</text><text start="729.77" dur="13.25">basically that of emptiness -- you know
more about emptiness, so emptiness will be</text><text start="743.02" dur="3.259">emphasized in whatsoever you teach.</text><text start="746.279" dur="3.25">That&amp;#39;s what happened in Buddha&amp;#39;s case.</text><text start="749.529" dur="12.491">He had attained through emptiness, hence his
whole teaching became emptiness-oriented.</text><text start="762.02" dur="8.039">There is no God in Buddha&amp;#39;s teaching,
because God is a thought, a content, an object</text><text start="770.059" dur="10.541">-- God is the other, and Buddha had
attained by dropping the other.</text><text start="780.6" dur="5.22">Buddha had attained by emptying his mind totally,
hence</text><text start="785.82" dur="8.42">there is no place for God, no place for anything
at all.</text><text start="794.24" dur="4.94">His path is the purest VIA
NEGATIVA.</text><text start="799.18" dur="5.23">That was also the case with Dharmakirti.</text><text start="804.41" dur="11.61">He was 
the perfect master of emptiness, a</text><text start="816.02" dur="6.48">master par excellence of emptiness.</text><text start="822.5" dur="8.06">And when Atisha had learned how to be empty,
the</text><text start="830.56" dur="11.05">master said, &amp;quot;It will be better for you to
go to Dharmarakshita for the next step, because</text><text start="841.61" dur="4.08">he has attained from a totally different path.</text><text start="845.69" dur="8.97">Just as you can reach Everest from different
sides, he has reached from a totally different</text><text start="854.66" dur="3.62">path, the path of compassion.</text><text start="858.28" dur="6.47">I can also
teach you the path of compassion, but my knowing</text><text start="864.75" dur="8.47">about that path is only known from
the top.</text><text start="873.22" dur="5.73">&amp;quot;I have reached through the path of emptiness.</text><text start="878.95" dur="4.61">Once you reach the top, you can look
down at all the paths, they are all available</text><text start="883.56" dur="2.73">to your vision.</text><text start="886.29" dur="12.14">But to follow a path in its
different dimensions, to follow a path in</text><text start="898.43" dur="5.64">all its details, small details, is a totally
different</text><text start="904.07" dur="1">thing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="905.07" dur="5.06">And to look at it from a helicopter or from
the mountain-top is certainly a</text><text start="910.13" dur="5.3">different vision; it is a bird&amp;#39;s-eye view.</text><text start="915.43" dur="9.68">And Dharmakirti said, &amp;quot;If there had been nobody
available here, I would have taught you</text><text start="925.11" dur="2.18">the other too.</text><text start="927.29" dur="7.44">But when a man like Dharmarakshita is just
here, my neighbor, living in</text><text start="934.73" dur="11.26">another cave just nearby, it is better you
go to him.&amp;quot;</text><text start="945.99" dur="10.16">First one has to become empty, utterly empty.</text><text start="956.15" dur="11.21">But you have not to cling to emptiness,
otherwise your life will never know the positive</text><text start="967.36" dur="3.57">expression of religion.</text><text start="970.93" dur="8.73">Your life will
miss the poetry, the joy of sharing; you will</text><text start="979.66" dur="2.31">remain empty.</text><text start="981.97" dur="5.78">You will have a kind of
freedom, but your freedom will be only freedom</text><text start="987.75" dur="5.1">from, it will not be freedom FOR.</text><text start="992.85" dur="3.859">And
unless a freedom is both -- freedom from and</text><text start="996.709" dur="8">freedom for -- something is missing,
something is lacking; your freedom will be</text><text start="1004.709" dur="3.161">poor.</text><text start="1007.87" dur="6.58">Just to be free from is a poor kind of
freedom.</text><text start="1014.45" dur="5.54">The real freedom starts only when you are
free for.</text><text start="1019.99" dur="6.27">You can sing a song and you can
dance a dance and you can celebrate and you</text><text start="1026.26" dur="4.419">can start overflowing.</text><text start="1030.679" dur="3.671">That&amp;#39;s what
compassion is.</text><text start="1034.35" dur="2.889">Man lives in passion.</text><text start="1037.239" dur="9.661">When the mind disappears, passion is transformed
into compassion.</text><text start="1046.9" dur="12.029">Passion means you are a beggar with a begging-bowl;
you are asking and asking for more</text><text start="1058.929" dur="9.33">and more from everybody; you are exploiting
others.</text><text start="1068.259" dur="12.321">Your relationships are nothing but
exploitations -- cunning devices to possess</text><text start="1080.58" dur="10.539">the other, very clever strategies to dominate.</text><text start="1091.119" dur="12.26">When you are living in the mind, in passion,
your whole life is power politics.</text><text start="1103.379" dur="7.79">Even your
love, even your social service, even your</text><text start="1111.169" dur="6.38">humanitarian works, are nothing but power
politics.</text><text start="1117.549" dur="5.541">Deep down, there is a desire to be powerful
over others.</text><text start="1123.09" dur="8.339">The same energy, when the mind is dropped,
becomes compassion.</text><text start="1131.429" dur="3.87">And it takes a totally
new turn.</text><text start="1135.299" dur="6.58">It is no longer begging; you become an emperor,
you start giving.</text><text start="1141.879" dur="7.03">Now you
have something -- you had it always, but because</text><text start="1148.909" dur="3.941">of the mind, you were not aware of it.</text><text start="1152.85" dur="7.11">The mind was functioning like darkness around
you, and you were unaware of the light</text><text start="1159.96" dur="1.18">within.</text><text start="1161.14" dur="10.609">The mind was creating an illusion of being
a beggar, while all the time you had</text><text start="1171.749" dur="1.4">been an emperor.</text><text start="1173.149" dur="11.62">The mind was creating a dream; in reality
you never needed anything.</text><text start="1184.769" dur="4.321">All had already been given.</text><text start="1189.09" dur="6.429">All that you need, all that you can need,
is already the case.</text><text start="1195.519" dur="8.51">God is within you, but because of the mind
-- mind means dreaming, desiring -- you</text><text start="1204.029" dur="5.931">never look within, you go on rushing outwards.</text><text start="1209.96" dur="9.99">You keep yourself in the background,
your eyes are turned towards the outside,</text><text start="1219.95" dur="1.959">they have become focused there.</text><text start="1221.909" dur="4.571">That&amp;#39;s what
the mind is all about: focusing the eyes on</text><text start="1226.48" dur="5.409">the outside.</text><text start="1231.889" dur="10.551">And one has to learn how to unfocus them from
there -- how to make them loose, less</text><text start="1242.44" dur="6.049">rigid, more liquid, so that they can turn
inwards.</text><text start="1248.489" dur="5.361">Once you have seen who you are, the
beggar disappears.</text><text start="1253.85" dur="5.429">In fact it had never existed; it was just
a dream, an idea.</text><text start="1259.279" dur="6.441">The mind is creating all your misery.</text><text start="1265.72" dur="10.87">With the mind gone, misery is gone, and suddenly
you are full of energy.</text><text start="1276.59" dur="6.059">And the energy needs expression, sharing;
it wants to become a</text><text start="1282.649" dur="2.85">song, a dance, a celebration.</text><text start="1285.499" dur="5.081">That is compassion: you start sharing.</text><text start="1290.58" dur="8.61">Atisha learned compassion from Dharmarakshita.</text><text start="1299.19" dur="2.859">But compassion has two faces.</text><text start="1302.049" dur="7.96">One is
inactive compassion: the meditator sits silently</text><text start="1310.009" dur="11.75">in his cave, showering his compassion
over the whole existence.</text><text start="1321.759" dur="5.5">But it is a very inactive kind of compassion.</text><text start="1327.259" dur="5.78">You have to go to
him to partake of it, he will not come to</text><text start="1333.039" dur="3.08">you.</text><text start="1336.119" dur="8.501">You will have to go to the mountains to his
cave to share his joy; he will not come to</text><text start="1344.62" dur="3.669">you.</text><text start="1348.289" dur="8.52">He will not move in any way, he will not
take any active step.</text><text start="1356.809" dur="7.221">He will not flow towards others, he will not
seek and search for the</text><text start="1364.03" dur="3.93">people with whom he can share his dance.</text><text start="1367.96" dur="3.48">He will wait.</text><text start="1371.44" dur="7.739">This is a feminine kind of compassion: just
like a woman waits -- she never takes the</text><text start="1379.179" dur="5.22">initiative, she never goes to the man.</text><text start="1384.399" dur="3.11">She may love the man, but she will never be
the first</text><text start="1387.509" dur="2.731">to say &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1390.24" dur="9.749">She will wait; she will hope that one day
or other, sooner or later, the</text><text start="1399.989" dur="2.341">man will propose.</text><text start="1402.33" dur="9.37">Woman is inactive love, passive love.</text><text start="1411.7" dur="8.679">Man is active love, man takes
the initiative.</text><text start="1420.379" dur="9.4">And in the same way, compassion has two possibilities:
the feminine and the masculine.</text><text start="1429.779" dur="10.34">From Dharmarakshita, Atisha learned the feminine
art of being in love with existence.</text><text start="1440.119" dur="9.49">One more step was needed: Dharmarakshita told
him, &amp;quot;Go to Yogin Maitreya&amp;quot; -- these</text><text start="1449.609" dur="13.581">three masters were all living together in
the same vicinity -- &amp;quot;Go to Yogin Maitreya</text><text start="1463.19" dur="5.219">and
learn how to transform the baser energy into</text><text start="1468.409" dur="8.421">active energy, so love becomes active.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1476.83" dur="12.419">And once love is active, compassion is active,
you have passed through all the three</text><text start="1489.249" dur="4.91">dimensions of truth -- you have known all.</text><text start="1494.159" dur="10.24">You have known utter emptiness, you have
known compassion arising, you have known compassion</text><text start="1504.399" dur="3.291">showering.</text><text start="1507.69" dur="11.979">Life is fulfilled only
when all these three have happened.</text><text start="1519.669" dur="11.811">Because Atisha learned under three enlightened
masters, he is called Atisha the Thrice</text><text start="1531.48" dur="4.169">Great.</text><text start="1535.649" dur="7.88">Nothing more is known about his ordinary life,
when and where exactly he was</text><text start="1543.529" dur="2.431">born.</text><text start="1545.96" dur="5.849">He existed somewhere in the eleventh century.</text><text start="1551.809" dur="9.11">He was born in India, but the
moment his love became active he started moving</text><text start="1560.919" dur="9.26">towards Tibet, as if a great magnet
were pulling him there.</text><text start="1570.179" dur="7.281">In the Himalayas he attained; then he never
came back to India.</text><text start="1577.46" dur="7.909">He moved towards Tibet, his love showered
on Tibet.</text><text start="1585.369" dur="9.351">He transformed the whole quality
of Tibetan consciousness.</text><text start="1594.72" dur="5.88">He was a miracle-worker; whatsoever he touched
was</text><text start="1600.6" dur="1.91">transformed into gold.</text><text start="1602.51" dur="9.99">He was one of the greatest alchemists the
world has ever known.</text><text start="1612.5" dur="8.45">These &amp;quot;Seven Points of Mind Training&amp;quot; are
the fundamental teaching that he gave to</text><text start="1620.95" dur="6.659">Tibet -- a gift from India to Tibet.</text><text start="1627.609" dur="4.841">India has given great gifts to the world.</text><text start="1632.45" dur="6.41">Atisha is one
of those great gifts.</text><text start="1638.86" dur="12.369">Just as India gave Bodhidharma to China, India
gave Atisha to Tibet.</text><text start="1651.229" dur="9.88">Tibet is infinitely indebted to this man.</text><text start="1661.109" dur="11.511">These seven points, the smallest treatise
you can find, are of immense value.</text><text start="1672.62" dur="10.6">You will
have to meditate over each statement.</text><text start="1683.22" dur="8.439">They are the whole of religion condensed:
you will</text><text start="1691.659" dur="2.27">have to unfold each statement.</text><text start="1693.929" dur="7.73">They are like seeds, they contain much.</text><text start="1701.659" dur="4.86">It may not be
apparently so, but the moment you move into</text><text start="1706.519" dur="8.53">the statements deeply, when you
contemplate and meditate and start experimenting</text><text start="1715.049" dur="11.63">with them, you will be surprised -- you
will be going into the greatest adventure</text><text start="1726.679" dur="6.05">of your life.</text><text start="1732.729" dur="9.241">The first:
FIRST, LEARN THE PRELIMINARIES.</text><text start="1741.97" dur="2.929">What are the preliminaries?</text><text start="1744.899" dur="6.73">These are the preliminaries.</text><text start="1751.629" dur="5.87">First: truth is.</text><text start="1757.499" dur="10.85">Truth is not
something to be created, truth is not something</text><text start="1768.349" dur="4.54">that is far away.</text><text start="1772.889" dur="10.92">Truth is herenow, truth
surrounds you like the ocean surrounds the</text><text start="1783.809" dur="2.761">fish.</text><text start="1786.57" dur="7.069">The fish may not be aware -- once the
fish becomes aware of the ocean, the fish</text><text start="1793.639" dur="1.86">is enlightened.</text><text start="1795.499" dur="12.93">The fish is not aware, cannot be
aware, because the fish is born in the ocean,</text><text start="1808.429" dur="5.37">has always lived in the ocean, is part of
the</text><text start="1813.799" dur="3.23">ocean as any wave is part of the ocean.</text><text start="1817.029" dur="8.09">The fish is also a wave -- a little more solid,
but</text><text start="1825.119" dur="9.851">born out of the ocean, lives in the ocean
and one day disappears in the ocean.</text><text start="1834.97" dur="5.689">The fish
may never come to know about the ocean.</text><text start="1840.659" dur="4.52">To know something, a little distance is needed.</text><text start="1845.179" dur="4.06">To know something, perspective is needed.</text><text start="1849.239" dur="7.24">And the ocean is so close, that&amp;#39;s why the
fish</text><text start="1856.479" dur="5.041">may not be aware of it.</text><text start="1861.52" dur="9.649">And so is the case with truth, or if you like
you can use the word god.</text><text start="1871.169" dur="4.151">So is the case with
god.</text><text start="1875.32" dur="6.959">It is not that he is far away, and that&amp;#39;s
why we don&amp;#39;t know about him; it is because</text><text start="1882.279" dur="6.191">he
is not far away but very close by.</text><text start="1888.47" dur="3.88">Even to say that it is close by is not right,
because you</text><text start="1892.35" dur="2.319">are it.</text><text start="1894.669" dur="6.531">He is within you and without: he is all and
all.</text><text start="1901.2" dur="11.299">This is the first thing that has to be allowed
to sink deep in your heart: truth already</text><text start="1912.499" dur="4.331">is, we
are in it.</text><text start="1916.83" dur="7.179">This is the most fundamental thing to begin
with.</text><text start="1924.009" dur="8.191">You are not to discover it; it is
not covered.</text><text start="1932.2" dur="7.349">All that is needed is a new kind of awareness
which is missing in you.</text><text start="1939.549" dur="3.5">Truth
is there, but you are not aware, you are not</text><text start="1943.049" dur="6.161">mindful, you are not alert.</text><text start="1949.21" dur="6.969">You don&amp;#39;t know
how to watch, you don&amp;#39;t know how to observe,</text><text start="1956.179" dur="5.63">you don&amp;#39;t know how to look and see.</text><text start="1961.809" dur="5.6">You
have eyes but still you are blind, you have</text><text start="1967.409" dur="3.74">ears but you are deaf.</text><text start="1971.149" dur="5.71">The first preliminary is: truth is.</text><text start="1976.859" dur="11.25">The second preliminary is: mind is the barrier.</text><text start="1988.109" dur="7.86">Nothing else is hindering you from truth,
just your own mind.</text><text start="1995.969" dur="7.511">Mind surrounds you like a film, like a movie
that goes on and on,</text><text start="2003.48" dur="10.49">and you remain engrossed in it, fascinated
by it.</text><text start="2013.97" dur="10.02">It is a fantasy that surrounds you, a
continuous story that goes on and on.</text><text start="2023.99" dur="5.71">And because you are so fascinated by it, you
go on</text><text start="2029.7" dur="4.229">missing that which is.</text><text start="2033.929" dur="8.13">And mind is not; it is only a fantasy, it
is only a faculty for</text><text start="2042.059" dur="1.801">dreaming.</text><text start="2043.86" dur="10.279">Mind is nothing but dreams and dreams -- dreams
of the past, dreams of the future,</text><text start="2054.139" dur="10.871">dreams of how things should be, dreams of
great ambitions, achievements.</text><text start="2065.01" dur="5.18">Dreams and
desires, that is the stuff mind is made of.</text><text start="2070.19" dur="3.969">But it surrounds you like a China Wall.</text><text start="2074.159" dur="5.14">And
because of it the fish remains unaware of</text><text start="2079.299" dur="2.28">the ocean.</text><text start="2081.579" dur="7.55">So the second preliminary is: mind is the
only barrier.</text><text start="2089.129" dur="5.77">And the third: no-mind is the door.</text><text start="2094.899" dur="7.991">Atisha calls no-mind BODHICHITTA: that is
his</text><text start="2102.89" dur="3.15">word for no-mind.</text><text start="2106.04" dur="8.38">It can be translated as buddha-mind, buddha-consciousness,
too.</text><text start="2114.42" dur="6.639">Or if
you like you can call it christ-consciousness,</text><text start="2121.059" dur="1.891">krishna-consciousness.</text><text start="2122.95" dur="6.919">It doesn&amp;#39;t make any
difference what name is used, but the basic</text><text start="2129.869" dur="8.041">quality of bodhichitta is that it is no-mind.</text><text start="2137.91" dur="10.77">It
looks paradoxical: the mind in the state of</text><text start="2148.68" dur="3.84">no-mind.</text><text start="2152.52" dur="13.18">But the meaning is very clear: mind
without content, mind without thoughts, is</text><text start="2165.7" dur="4.01">what is meant, is what is indicated.</text><text start="2169.71" dur="9.5">Remember the word bodhichitta, because Atisha
says the whole effort of religion, the</text><text start="2179.21" dur="9.42">whole science of religion, is nothing but
an endeavor to create bodhichitta, buddhaconsciousness:</text><text start="2188.63" dur="6.11">a mind which functions as a no-mind, a mind
which dreams no more,</text><text start="2194.74" dur="8.44">thinks no more, a mind which is just awareness,
pure awareness.</text><text start="2203.18" dur="1.48">These are the preliminaries.</text><text start="2204.66" dur="7.139">The 
second sutra:</text><text start="2211.799" dur="4.381">THINK THAT ALL PHENOMENA ARE LIKE DREAMS....</text><text start="2216.18" dur="1.21">Now the work starts.</text><text start="2217.39" dur="12.76">Atisha is very condensed, seedlike.</text><text start="2230.15" dur="10.909">That is the meaning of a sutra: it
is just a thread, just a hint, and then you</text><text start="2241.059" dur="2.651">have to decode it.</text><text start="2243.71" dur="4.8">THINK THAT ALL PHENOMENA ARE LIKE DREAMS.</text><text start="2248.51" dur="9.59">&amp;quot;Phenomena&amp;quot; means all that you see, all that
you experience.</text><text start="2258.1" dur="3.82">All that can ever be
experienced is all phenomena.</text><text start="2261.92" dur="5.78">Remember, not only are the objects of the
world</text><text start="2267.7" dur="7.23">phenomena and dreams, but also objects of
consciousness.</text><text start="2274.93" dur="7.649">They may be objects of the
world, they may be just objects of the mind.</text><text start="2282.579" dur="3.691">They may be great spiritual experiences.</text><text start="2286.27" dur="7.52">You may see kundalini rising in you: that
too is a phenomenon -- a beautiful dream,</text><text start="2293.79" dur="4.62">a
very sweet dream, but it is a dream all the</text><text start="2298.41" dur="1.86">same.</text><text start="2300.27" dur="8.589">You may see great light flooding your
being, but that light is also a phenomenon.</text><text start="2308.859" dur="8.101">You may see lotuses blooming inside you and
a great fragrance arising within your being:</text><text start="2316.96" dur="7.01">those too are phenomena, because you are
always the seer and never the seen, always</text><text start="2323.97" dur="11.98">the experiencer and never the experienced,
always the witness and never the witnessed.</text><text start="2335.95" dur="7.5">All that can be witnessed, seen, observed,
is phenomena.</text><text start="2343.45" dur="7.43">Material phenomena,
psychological phenomena, spiritual phenomena</text><text start="2350.88" dur="4.19">-- they are all the same.</text><text start="2355.07" dur="4.07">There is no need
to make any distinction.</text><text start="2359.14" dur="4.82">The basic thing to remember is: that which
can be seen is a</text><text start="2363.96" dur="3.909">dream.</text><text start="2367.869" dur="5.18">THINK THAT ALL PHENOMENA ARE DREAMS.</text><text start="2373.049" dur="6.251">This is a tremendously powerful technique.</text><text start="2379.3" dur="11.63">Start contemplating in this way: if you are
walking on the street, contemplate that people</text><text start="2390.93" dur="4.129">passing by are all dreams.</text><text start="2395.059" dur="5.181">The shops and
the shopkeepers and the customers and the</text><text start="2400.24" dur="4">people coming and going, all are dreams.</text><text start="2404.24" dur="5.26">The
houses, the buses, the train, the airplane,</text><text start="2409.5" dur="2.88">all are dreams.</text><text start="2412.38" dur="8.86">You will be immediately surprised by something
of tremendous import happening within</text><text start="2421.24" dur="1">you.</text><text start="2422.24" dur="8.65">The moment you think &amp;quot;All are dreams&amp;quot; suddenly,
like a flash, one thing comes into</text><text start="2430.89" dur="6.49">your vision: &amp;quot;I am a dream too.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2437.38" dur="10.87">Because if the seen is a dream, then who is
this &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;?</text><text start="2448.25" dur="3.45">If the
object is a dream, then the subject is also</text><text start="2451.7" dur="3.319">a dream.</text><text start="2455.019" dur="5.861">If the object is false, how can the
subject be the truth?</text><text start="2460.88" dur="1.219">Impossible.</text><text start="2462.099" dur="8.841">If you watch everything as a dream, suddenly
you will find something slipping out of</text><text start="2470.94" dur="4.71">your being: the idea of the ego.</text><text start="2475.65" dur="8.48">This is the only way to drop the ego, and
the simplest.</text><text start="2484.13" dur="5.03">Just try it -- meditate this way.</text><text start="2489.16" dur="3.53">Meditating this way again and again, one day
the miracle</text><text start="2492.69" dur="5.5">happens: you look in, and the ego is not found
there.</text><text start="2498.19" dur="7.07">The ego is a by-product, a by-product of the
illusion that whatsoever you are seeing is</text><text start="2505.26" dur="2.68">true.</text><text start="2507.94" dur="8.579">If you think that objects are true, then the
ego can exist; it is a by-product.</text><text start="2516.519" dur="7.371">If you
think that objects are dreams, the ego disappears.</text><text start="2523.89" dur="7.99">And if you think continuously that all is
a dream, then one day, in a dream in the night,</text><text start="2531.88" dur="6.489">you will be surprised: suddenly in the
dream you will remember that this is a dream</text><text start="2538.369" dur="1.15">too!</text><text start="2539.519" dur="7.471">And immediately, as the remembrance
happens, the dream will disappear.</text><text start="2546.99" dur="3.829">And for the first time you will experience
yourself</text><text start="2550.819" dur="15.321">deep asleep, yet awake -- a very paradoxical
experience, but of great benefit.</text><text start="2566.14" dur="5.84">Once you have seen your dream disappearing
because you have become aware of the</text><text start="2571.98" dur="6.99">dream, your quality of consciousness will
have a new flavor to it.</text><text start="2578.97" dur="8.53">The next morning you
will wake up with a totally different quality</text><text start="2587.5" dur="1.95">you had never known before.</text><text start="2589.45" dur="2.919">You will wake
up for the first time.</text><text start="2592.369" dur="8.101">Now you will know that all those other mornings
were false; you</text><text start="2600.47" dur="2.72">were not really awake.</text><text start="2603.19" dur="5.01">The dreams continued -- the only difference
was that in the night</text><text start="2608.2" dur="6.57">you were dreaming with eyes closed, in the
day you were dreaming with eyes open.</text><text start="2614.77" dur="7.86">But if the dream has disappeared because awareness
happened, suddenly you became</text><text start="2622.63" dur="2.35">aware in the dream....</text><text start="2624.98" dur="5.539">And remember, awareness and dreaming cannot
exist together.</text><text start="2630.519" dur="6.951">Here, awareness arises, and there, the dream
disappears.</text><text start="2637.47" dur="11.73">When you become awake in
your sleep, the next morning is going to be</text><text start="2649.2" dur="9.97">something so important that it is
incomparable.</text><text start="2659.17" dur="3.189">Nothing like it has ever happened.</text><text start="2662.359" dur="9.641">Your eyes will be so clear, so
transparent, and everything will look so psychedelic,</text><text start="2672" dur="5.299">so colorful, so alive.</text><text start="2677.299" dur="12.842">Even rocks
will be felt to be breathing, pulsating; even</text><text start="2690.141" dur="3.708">rocks will have a heartbeat.</text><text start="2693.849" dur="9.161">When you are
awake, the whole existence changes its quality.</text><text start="2703.01" dur="7.46">We are living in a dream.</text><text start="2710.47" dur="6.53">We are asleep, even when we think we are awake.</text><text start="2717" dur="6.04">THINK THAT ALL PHENOMENA ARE LIKE DREAMS.</text><text start="2723.04" dur="4.95">First, objects will lose their objectivity.</text><text start="2727.99" dur="4.17">And second, the subject will lose its subjectivity.</text><text start="2732.16" dur="2.75">And that brings you to a transcendence.</text><text start="2734.91" dur="3.09">The object is no longer important, the subject
is</text><text start="2738" dur="2.819">no longer important, then what is left?</text><text start="2740.819" dur="5.021">A transcendental consciousness: bodhichitta
-- just</text><text start="2745.84" dur="12.35">a witnessing, with no idea of &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;thou&amp;#39;;
just a pure mirror which reflects that which</text><text start="2758.19" dur="1.139">is.</text><text start="2759.329" dur="4.561">And God is nothing but that which is.</text><text start="2763.89" dur="6.09">The third sutra:
EXAMINE THE NATURE OF UNBORN AWARENESS.</text><text start="2769.98" dur="5.9">Now you know what awareness is.</text><text start="2775.88" dur="5.399">You have known this transcendental awareness
where</text><text start="2781.279" dur="7.601">objects and subjects are no more existential.</text><text start="2788.88" dur="8.04">You have known for the first time this
purity, this crystal-clear mirror.</text><text start="2796.92" dur="5.79">Now examine the nature of this awareness.</text><text start="2802.71" dur="4.78">Look into it, look deep into it.</text><text start="2807.49" dur="11.89">Shake yourself into as full alertness as possible.</text><text start="2819.38" dur="5.04">Wake up
and see!</text><text start="2824.42" dur="7.09">And you will start laughing -- because now
you will see there has never been a</text><text start="2831.51" dur="5.18">birth, and there is never going to be a death.</text><text start="2836.69" dur="4.879">This is unborn and undying consciousness.</text><text start="2841.569" dur="1.871">It has always been here.</text><text start="2843.44" dur="5.95">It is eternal, it is
timeless.</text><text start="2849.39" dur="7.61">And how afraid you were of death, and how
afraid you were of old age, and</text><text start="2857" dur="3.69">how afraid you were of a thousand and one
things!</text><text start="2860.69" dur="7.91">And nothing has ever happened: all
was a dream.</text><text start="2868.6" dur="9.28">Seeing this, one smiles, one laughs.</text><text start="2877.88" dur="8.56">Your whole life up to now has been ridiculous,
absurd.</text><text start="2886.44" dur="10.35">You were unnecessarily afraid, unnecessarily
greedy, unnecessarily suffering.</text><text start="2896.79" dur="9.48">You were living in a nightmare and it was
your own creation.</text><text start="2906.27" dur="2.38">EXAMINE THE NATURE OF UNBORN AWARENESS.</text><text start="2908.65" dur="11.199">And you are freed from all misery, all suffering,
all hell.</text><text start="2919.849" dur="4.611">LET EVEN THE REMEDY ITSELF GO FREE ON ITS
OWN.</text><text start="2924.46" dur="10.07">And now don&amp;#39;t start clinging to the remedy,
to the method.</text><text start="2934.53" dur="2.339">That temptation arises.</text><text start="2936.869" dur="9.591">It is
the last temptation, the very last effort</text><text start="2946.46" dur="6.17">of the mind to survive.</text><text start="2952.63" dur="6.5">The mind comes from a
back door, it tries once more.</text><text start="2959.13" dur="9.36">Before it disappears forever, it makes one
more effort, and</text><text start="2968.49" dur="11.289">that effort is to cling to the method -- the
method of thinking that all phenomena are</text><text start="2979.779" dur="2.48">dreams.</text><text start="2982.259" dur="8.58">It has given you such joy, such a deep experience
of reality, that naturally you would like</text><text start="2990.839" dur="3.331">to cling to it.</text><text start="2994.17" dur="8.07">And once you cling you are back in the same
old rut again: the mind is back</text><text start="3002.24" dur="3.39">in disguise.</text><text start="3005.63" dur="5.65">Cling to anything and the mind is back, because
clinging is mind.</text><text start="3011.28" dur="6.079">Hold on to
anything, depend on anything, and the mind</text><text start="3017.359" dur="5.45">is back, because the mind is dependence,
slavery.</text><text start="3022.809" dur="8.361">Possess anything -- even a spiritual method,
even a method of meditation --</text><text start="3031.17" dur="3.629">become a possessor, and you are possessed
by it.</text><text start="3034.799" dur="6.861">Whether you possess money or you
possess a tremendously significant method</text><text start="3041.66" dur="2.709">of meditation, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="3044.369" dur="4.751">Whatsoever
you possess, you will be possessed by it and</text><text start="3049.12" dur="3.57">you will be afraid to lose it.</text><text start="3052.69" dur="3.74">Once a Sufi mystic was brought to me.</text><text start="3056.43" dur="3.649">For thirty years continuously he had used
the Sufi</text><text start="3060.079" dur="12.561">method ZIKR, and he had attained to great
experiences.</text><text start="3072.64" dur="9.54">One could see it; even ordinary
people were aware that he was living in a</text><text start="3082.18" dur="3.73">totally different world.</text><text start="3085.91" dur="5.54">You could see it in his
eyes, they were shining with joy.</text><text start="3091.45" dur="7.589">His very being had a vibe of the beyond.</text><text start="3099.039" dur="8.671">His disciples brought him to me, and they
said, &amp;quot;Our master is a realized soul.</text><text start="3107.71" dur="1.889">What do
you say about him?&amp;quot;</text><text start="3109.599" dur="10.371">I said, &amp;quot;Leave your master with me for three
days, and then come back.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3119.97" dur="1.94">The master stayed with me for three days.</text><text start="3121.91" dur="8.97">On the third day he was very angry, and he
said, &amp;quot;You have destroyed my thirty years&amp;#39;</text><text start="3130.88" dur="1.729">work!&amp;quot;</text><text start="3132.609" dur="8.41">Because I told him a simple thing --
just this sutra of Atisha: LET EVEN THE REMEDY</text><text start="3141.019" dur="3.711">ITSELF GO....</text><text start="3144.73" dur="6.889">I told him, &amp;quot;Now for thirty years you have
been remembering one thing, that all is divine.</text><text start="3151.619" dur="6.83">The tree is God, the rock is God, the people
are God, the dog is God, everything is God</text><text start="3158.449" dur="2.711">--
for thirty years you have been remembering</text><text start="3161.16" dur="1.78">it continuously.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3162.94" dur="2.829">And he had really made a
sincere effort.</text><text start="3165.769" dur="1.901">He said, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3167.67" dur="4.649">I said, &amp;quot;Now stop remembering.</text><text start="3172.319" dur="2.311">How long are you going to remember?</text><text start="3174.63" dur="3.29">If it has
happened, then stop remembering and let us</text><text start="3177.92" dur="3.56">see what happens.</text><text start="3181.48" dur="4.21">If it has really happened,
then even after dropping remembering, it will</text><text start="3185.69" dur="2.09">remain.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3187.78" dur="1.69">It was so logical that he agreed.</text><text start="3189.47" dur="2.42">He said, &amp;quot;It has happened.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3191.89" dur="3.52">I said, &amp;quot;Then give it a try.</text><text start="3195.41" dur="4.3">For three days you forget remembering, stop
remembering.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3199.71" dur="3.97">He said, &amp;quot;I cannot stop, it has become automatic.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3203.68" dur="7.55">I said, &amp;quot;You just wait and try.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3211.23" dur="5.359">It took him at least two days, forty-eight
hours, to stop.</text><text start="3216.589" dur="4.551">It was hard to stop, it had become
automatic.</text><text start="3221.14" dur="4.369">There was now no need to remember; for thirty
years he had been</text><text start="3225.509" dur="4.721">remembering, it was simply there like an undercurrent.</text><text start="3230.23" dur="7.95">But within forty-eight hours it
stopped.</text><text start="3238.18" dur="4.06">And on the morning of the third day he was
very angry.</text><text start="3242.24" dur="4.099">He said, &amp;quot;What have you done?</text><text start="3246.339" dur="2.591">All that joy has disappeared.</text><text start="3248.93" dur="9.77">I am feeling very ordinary, I am feeling the
same as I was</text><text start="3258.7" dur="4.27">before I started on the journey thirty years
ago.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3262.97" dur="8.19">He started crying out of anger and out of
sadness; tears started coming to his eyes.</text><text start="3271.16" dur="4.25">He said, &amp;quot;Give me back my method -- please
don&amp;#39;t take it!&amp;quot;</text><text start="3275.41" dur="2.199">I said, &amp;quot;Just look!</text><text start="3277.609" dur="7.5">If this is so dependent on the method, then
nothing has happened.</text><text start="3285.109" dur="3.091">It is
just an illusion that you are creating by</text><text start="3288.2" dur="4.869">continuous remembering.</text><text start="3293.069" dur="6.021">This is nothing but
autohypnosis.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3299.09" dur="5.61">All the great masters say this, that one day
you have to drop the method.</text><text start="3304.7" dur="2.109">And the sooner
you drop it, the better.</text><text start="3306.809" dur="7.391">The moment you attain, the moment awareness
is released in you,</text><text start="3314.2" dur="1.46">immediately drop the method.</text><text start="3315.66" dur="3.419">Just look: this is only the fourth sutra.</text><text start="3319.079" dur="5.44">In the third sutra Atisha says:
EXAMINE THE NATURE OF UNBORN AWARENESS.</text><text start="3324.519" dur="5.751">And in the fourth, immediately:
LET EVEN THE REMEDY ITSELF GO....</text><text start="3330.27" dur="9.229">Now no more examination, no more mindfulness,
no more remembering that all is a</text><text start="3339.499" dur="1.461">dream.</text><text start="3340.96" dur="8.5">Once the first taste of awareness has happened
on your tongue, be quick!</text><text start="3349.46" dur="4.35">Because
the mind is very cunning -- the mind can start</text><text start="3353.81" dur="7.949">telling you, &amp;quot;Look, you are no longer
ordinary, you are extraordinary.</text><text start="3361.759" dur="4.751">Look, you have attained.</text><text start="3366.51" dur="6.99">Look, you have become a
buddha, you are enlightened.</text><text start="3373.5" dur="9.829">Look, this is the goal of all human beings,
and very rarely,</text><text start="3383.329" dur="1.861">one in a million attains.</text><text start="3385.19" dur="3.76">You are that one in a million.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3388.95" dur="9.619">The mind will say all these beautiful sweet
nothings, and of course the ego can come</text><text start="3398.569" dur="1.7">back.</text><text start="3400.269" dur="6.241">You can start feeling very good, holier than
thou.</text><text start="3406.51" dur="6.71">You can start feeling special,
spiritual, saintly.</text><text start="3413.22" dur="2.319">And all is lost.</text><text start="3415.539" dur="6.28">Through the remedy, the disease is back.</text><text start="3421.819" dur="7.831">Cling to the
remedy, and the disease is back.</text><text start="3429.65" dur="3.969">One has to be very alert about dropping the
method.</text><text start="3433.619" dur="5.13">Once you attain something,
immediately drop the method, otherwise your</text><text start="3438.749" dur="2.6">mind will start clinging to the method.</text><text start="3441.349" dur="2.72">It
will talk very logically to you, saying, &amp;quot;It</text><text start="3444.069" dur="3.661">is the method that is important.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3447.73" dur="4.75">Buddha used to tell a story again and again.</text><text start="3452.48" dur="8.519">Five idiots passed through a village.</text><text start="3460.999" dur="4.442">Seeing
them, people were surprised, because they</text><text start="3465.441" dur="3.699">were carrying a boat on their heads.</text><text start="3469.14" dur="4.939">The boat
was really big; it was almost crushing those</text><text start="3474.079" dur="3.46">five idiots, they were almost dying under
the</text><text start="3477.539" dur="1.601">weight of it.</text><text start="3479.14" dur="1.8">And people asked, &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot;</text><text start="3480.94" dur="2.61">They said, &amp;quot;We cannot leave this boat.</text><text start="3483.55" dur="3.39">This is the boat that helped us to come from
the</text><text start="3486.94" dur="3.48">other shore to this shore.</text><text start="3490.42" dur="3.28">How can we leave it?</text><text start="3493.7" dur="4.629">It is because of it that we have been able
to come here.</text><text start="3498.329" dur="5.301">Without it we would have died on the other
shore.</text><text start="3503.63" dur="4.729">The night was coming
close, and there were wild animals on the</text><text start="3508.359" dur="3">other shore.</text><text start="3511.359" dur="5.051">It was as sure as anything that by
the morning we would have been dead.</text><text start="3516.41" dur="5.16">We will never leave this boat, we are indebted
forever.</text><text start="3521.57" dur="7.56">We will carry it on our heads in sheer gratitude.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3529.13" dur="6.729">This can happen, because all minds are idiots.</text><text start="3535.859" dur="11.71">Mind as such is idiotic.</text><text start="3547.569" dur="5.45">The origin of the word idiot is beautiful
to remember.</text><text start="3553.019" dur="15.371">Idiocy means something private,
something special, something that is your</text><text start="3568.39" dur="4.8">own, something eccentric.</text><text start="3573.19" dur="9.559">That is the basic
meaning of idiocy -- to function in an eccentric</text><text start="3582.749" dur="2.37">way.</text><text start="3585.119" dur="14">The mind always functions in an eccentric
way, the mind is always an idiot.</text><text start="3599.119" dur="4.46">The really
intelligent person has no mind.</text><text start="3603.579" dur="7.901">Intelligence arises out of no-mind, idiocy
out of the mind.</text><text start="3611.48" dur="6.91">Mind is idiotic, no-mind is wise.</text><text start="3618.39" dur="5.919">No-mind is wisdom, intelligence.</text><text start="3624.309" dur="7.331">Mind depends on knowledge, on methods, on
money, on experience, on this and that.</text><text start="3631.64" dur="8.209">Mind always needs props, it needs supports,
it cannot exist on its own.</text><text start="3639.849" dur="5.381">On its own, it
flops.</text><text start="3645.23" dur="6.079">So the ultimate effort of the mind to come
back will be when you attain to some</text><text start="3651.309" dur="1.621">awareness.</text><text start="3652.93" dur="12.129">It will say, &amp;quot;Look, so we have arrived.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3665.059" dur="9.74">The moment something inside you
says, &amp;quot;We have arrived,&amp;quot; beware!</text><text start="3674.799" dur="6.191">Be very very cautious now, each step has to
be of great</text><text start="3680.99" dur="2.2">caution.</text><text start="3683.19" dur="5.52">LET EVEN THE REMEDY ITSELF GO FREE ON ITS
OWN.</text><text start="3688.71" dur="11.99">Now please don&amp;#39;t cling to the remedy, to the
method.</text><text start="3700.7" dur="6.579">This is the emphasis of J.
Krishnamurti -- but this is his first sutra.</text><text start="3707.279" dur="5.141">It should be the fourth.</text><text start="3712.42" dur="5.859">That&amp;#39;s where he is
wrong; it cannot be the first sutra.</text><text start="3718.279" dur="7.451">How can you drop a method that you have never
used?</text><text start="3725.73" dur="4.379">You can only drop a method that you have used.</text><text start="3730.109" dur="6.651">Atisha is far more logical, far more scientific,
than J. Krishnamurti.</text><text start="3736.76" dur="7.769">But I can understand
why he emphasizes it, because he is afraid</text><text start="3744.529" dur="2.121">that if you go into the first three sutras
the</text><text start="3746.65" dur="6.24">fourth may never arrive, you may be lost in
the first three.</text><text start="3752.89" dur="8.949">Many are lost in the
preliminaries, many are lost in the methods.</text><text start="3761.839" dur="8.351">So he has become too cautious, extremely
cautious.</text><text start="3770.19" dur="8.02">Those five idiots were carrying the boat,
and J. Krishnamurti is on the other shore</text><text start="3778.21" dur="9.369">teaching people: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t enter the boat&amp;quot; -- too
cautious! -- &amp;quot;because if you enter the boat,</text><text start="3787.579" dur="4.28">who knows, you may start carrying the boat
on your head.</text><text start="3791.859" dur="3.821">So please don&amp;#39;t enter it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3795.68" dur="7.569">And there are many who have become afraid
of entering the boat.</text><text start="3803.249" dur="5.611">But to be afraid of
entering the boat is the same idiocy; there</text><text start="3808.86" dur="1.42">is no difference.</text><text start="3810.28" dur="4.529">One who is afraid of entering
the boat is the same person who will carry</text><text start="3814.809" dur="8.55">the boat; otherwise why should you be afraid?</text><text start="3823.359" dur="6.781">There are old friends of mine who have followed
J. Krishnamurti for their whole life.</text><text start="3830.14" dur="6.76">They come to me and say, &amp;quot;We would like to
come here, but we are afraid of all the</text><text start="3836.9" dur="2.919">methods that you teach.</text><text start="3839.819" dur="9.851">Methods are dangerous,&amp;quot; they say.</text><text start="3849.67" dur="6.629">Methods are dangerous only if you are unaware;
otherwise they can be used beautifully.</text><text start="3856.299" dur="4.661">Do you think a boat is dangerous?</text><text start="3860.96" dur="4.329">It is dangerous if you are thinking to carry
it on your</text><text start="3865.289" dur="10.961">head for your whole life out of sheer gratitude;
otherwise it is just a raft to be used and</text><text start="3876.25" dur="1.869">discarded.</text><text start="3878.119" dur="11.341">All methods are rafts to be used and discarded,
used and abandoned, used and</text><text start="3889.46" dur="7.349">never looked back at again -- there is no
need, no point!</text><text start="3896.809" dur="1.241">These are two extremes.</text><text start="3898.05" dur="6.44">At one extreme are those five idiots, and
at the other extreme are</text><text start="3904.49" dur="7.359">the followers of J. Krishnamurti.</text><text start="3911.849" dur="2.551">There is no need to be either.</text><text start="3914.4" dur="10.899">My approach is: Use the
boat, use beautiful boats, use as many boats</text><text start="3925.299" dur="17.871">as possible; with this awareness, when the
shore is reached the boat is abandoned with</text><text start="3943.17" dur="1.25">no clinging.</text><text start="3944.42" dur="9.74">While you are in the boat, enjoy
it, be thankful to it.</text><text start="3954.16" dur="6.619">When you get out of the boat, say thank you
and move on.</text><text start="3960.779" dur="7.22">The fifth sutra:
SETTLE IN THE NATURE OF BASIC COGNITION, THE</text><text start="3967.999" dur="1.661">ESSENCE.</text><text start="3969.66" dur="11.76">If you drop the remedy, automatically you
will start settling in your being.</text><text start="3981.42" dur="7.5">The mind
clings; it never allows you to settle in your</text><text start="3988.92" dur="1.24">being.</text><text start="3990.16" dur="7.98">It keeps you interested in something
that you are not: the boats.</text><text start="3998.14" dur="7.13">When you don&amp;#39;t cling to anything, there is
nowhere to go -- all boats have been</text><text start="4005.27" dur="7.36">abandoned, you cannot go anywhere; all paths
have been dropped, you cannot go</text><text start="4012.63" dur="8.669">anywhere; all dreams and desires have disappeared,
there is no way to move.</text><text start="4021.299" dur="5.141">Relaxation
happens of its own accord.</text><text start="4026.44" dur="4.34">Just think of the word relax.</text><text start="4030.78" dur="10.61">Be, settle, you have come home.</text><text start="4041.39" dur="3.219">SETTLE IN THE NATURE OF BASIC COGNITION, THE
ESSENCE.</text><text start="4044.609" dur="11.17">And when you settle, there is pure awareness,
with no effort, with no method.</text><text start="4055.779" dur="4.82">If
awareness needs a method it is still not true</text><text start="4060.599" dur="6.871">awareness, not the essential awareness, not
the natural spontaneous awareness.</text><text start="4067.47" dur="5.96">It is still a by-product of the method; it
is cultivated,</text><text start="4073.43" dur="2.7">created.</text><text start="4076.13" dur="7.75">It is a by-product of the mind, it is not
yet the truth.</text><text start="4083.88" dur="4.719">SETTLE IN THE NATURE OF BASIC COGNITION, THE
ESSENCE.</text><text start="4088.599" dur="3.541">Now there is nothing to do.</text><text start="4092.14" dur="14.29">See, be, enjoy: only this moment exists.</text><text start="4106.43" dur="16.75">This now, this here,
this cawing of the crows... and all is silence.</text><text start="4123.18" dur="15.4">To know this serenity is to know who you are,
what this existence is all about.</text><text start="4138.58" dur="7.02">This is
samadhi, in the words of Patanjali.</text><text start="4145.6" dur="8.11">This is SAMBODHI, in the words of Gautam Buddha.</text><text start="4153.71" dur="7.25">This is bodhichitta, in the words of Atisha.</text><text start="4160.96" dur="4.48">BETWEEN SESSIONS, CONSIDER PHENOMENA AS PHANTOMS.</text><text start="4165.44" dur="12.41">Now Atisha is really very aware of the disciple.</text><text start="4177.85" dur="8.95">He knows that these experiences of
settling into your being will be only momentary</text><text start="4186.8" dur="2.09">in the beginning.</text><text start="4188.89" dur="6.24">One moment you will
find yourself relaxed into your being, another</text><text start="4195.13" dur="2.45">moment it will be gone.</text><text start="4197.58" dur="8.21">In the beginning it
is bound to be so: one moment you are flooded</text><text start="4205.79" dur="6.75">with the unknown, with the mysterious,
another moment it is no more there.</text><text start="4212.54" dur="3.81">One moment all is fragrance, and the next
moment</text><text start="4216.35" dur="4.92">you are searching for it and you cannot find
it, where it has gone.</text><text start="4221.27" dur="2.26">Only glimpses will happen in the beginning.</text><text start="4223.53" dur="8.43">Slowly slowly they become more and more
solid, they abide more and more.</text><text start="4231.96" dur="9.8">Slowly slowly, slowly slowly, very slowly,
they settle</text><text start="4241.76" dur="2.37">forever.</text><text start="4244.13" dur="15.3">Before that you cannot 
be allowed to </text><text start="4259.43" dur="6.02">take it for granted; that will be a mistake.</text><text start="4265.45" dur="3.09">Hence he says: Between sessions....</text><text start="4268.54" dur="9.96">When you are sitting in meditation, a session
of meditation, this will happen -- but it</text><text start="4278.5" dur="1.29">will
go.</text><text start="4279.79" dur="3.38">So what are you supposed to do between sessions?</text><text start="4283.17" dur="3.99">BETWEEN SESSIONS, CONSIDER PHENOMENA AS PHANTOMS.</text><text start="4287.16" dur="5.19">Between sessions, continue to use the method.</text><text start="4292.35" dur="3.44">Drop the method when you are deep in
meditation.</text><text start="4295.79" dur="6.45">The moment comes, as awareness is getting
purer and purer, when suddenly</text><text start="4302.24" dur="7.471">it is utterly pure: drop the method, abandon
the method, forget all about the remedy, just</text><text start="4309.711" dur="2.349">settle and be.</text><text start="4312.06" dur="4.78">But this will happen only for moments in the
beginning.</text><text start="4316.84" dur="4.66">Sometimes it happens here
listening to me.</text><text start="4321.5" dur="10.44">Just for a moment, like a breeze, you are
transported into another world,</text><text start="4331.94" dur="2.56">the world of no-mind.</text><text start="4334.5" dur="6.63">Just for a moment, you know that you know
-- but only for a</text><text start="4341.13" dur="1">moment.</text><text start="4342.13" dur="10.84">And again the darkness gathers and the mind
is back with all its dreams, with all</text><text start="4352.97" dur="3.49">its desires and all its stupidities.</text><text start="4356.46" dur="6.74">For a moment the clouds had separated and
you had seen the sun.</text><text start="4363.2" dur="4.98">Now the clouds are
there again; it is all dark and the sun has</text><text start="4368.18" dur="1">disappeared.</text><text start="4369.18" dur="4.19">Now even to believe that the sun
exists will be difficult.</text><text start="4373.37" dur="5.09">Now to believe that what you had experienced
a moment before</text><text start="4378.46" dur="3.06">was true will be difficult.</text><text start="4381.52" dur="5.58">It may have been a fantasy; the mind may say
it may have just</text><text start="4387.1" dur="2.6">been imagination.</text><text start="4389.7" dur="9.89">It is so incredible, it looks so impossible,
that it could have happened to YOU.</text><text start="4399.59" dur="5.17">With all
this stupidity in the mind, with all these</text><text start="4404.76" dur="4.23">clouds and darknesses, it had happened to
you:</text><text start="4408.99" dur="1.85">you saw the sun for a moment.</text><text start="4410.84" dur="4.12">It doesn&amp;#39;t look probable -- you must have
imagined it;</text><text start="4414.96" dur="4.44">maybe you had fallen into a dream and seen
it.</text><text start="4419.4" dur="11.14">Between sessions start again, be in the boat,
use the boat again.</text><text start="4430.54" dur="2.53">... CONSIDER PHENOMENA AS PHANTOMS.</text><text start="4433.07" dur="4.97">Atisha is very considerate to the disciples.</text><text start="4438.04" dur="10.22">Otherwise the fourth sutra would have been
the last -- or, at the most, the fifth:</text><text start="4448.26" dur="6.49">SETTLE IN THE NATURE OF BASIC COGNITION, THE
ESSENCE.</text><text start="4454.75" dur="9.27">If Atisha had been a man like Bodhidharma,
the treatise would have finished at the fifth</text><text start="4464.02" dur="8.75">sutra, or even at the fourth:
LET EVEN THE REMEDY ITSELF GO FREE ON ITS</text><text start="4472.77" dur="1.03">OWN.</text><text start="4473.8" dur="2.03">Then the settling happens on its own.</text><text start="4475.83" dur="2.54">Bodhidharma was very miserly, he would not
have</text><text start="4478.37" dur="9.96">used the fifth, but Atisha is very considerate
to the disciple.</text><text start="4488.33" dur="4.82">He had been a disciple, so he
knew the difficulties of a disciple.</text><text start="4493.15" dur="3.481">And he had been a disciple of three great
masters, so</text><text start="4496.631" dur="8.329">he knew all the difficulties that a disciple
has to face.</text><text start="4504.96" dur="4.33">He had been a pilgrim; he knew all
the problems.</text><text start="4509.29" dur="7.35">And he had been a pilgrim on three paths,
all the three possible paths, so he</text><text start="4516.64" dur="6.94">knew all the problems and all the difficulties
and all the pitfalls and all the obstacles</text><text start="4523.58" dur="6.13">that
are bound to arise on the path of a disciple.</text><text start="4529.71" dur="2.16">Hence his considerateness.</text><text start="4531.87" dur="2.44">He says: Between
sessions....</text><text start="4534.31" dur="6.54">Between these moments of meditativeness, between
these moments of utter joy,</text><text start="4540.85" dur="11.49">emptiness and purity, between these moments
of being, remember that all are dreams,</text><text start="4552.34" dur="2.39">that every phenomenon is a phantom.</text><text start="4554.73" dur="3.99">Go on using this method till the settling
has</text><text start="4558.72" dur="1.57">happened forever.</text><text start="4560.29" dur="7.19">TRAIN IN JOINING, SENDING AND TAKING TOGETHER.DO
THIS BY RIDING</text><text start="4567.48" dur="4.31">THE BREATH.</text><text start="4571.79" dur="11.2">Now emptiness has been experienced -- this
is what he had learned.</text><text start="4582.99" dur="15.8">Up to this sutra he
had been with the first master, Dharmakirti.</text><text start="4598.79" dur="6.69">With this sutra, the second master,
Dharmarakshita.</text><text start="4605.48" dur="4.92">TRAIN IN JOINING, SENDING AND TAKING TOGETHER.DO
THIS BY RIDING</text><text start="4610.4" dur="1.38">THE BREATH.</text><text start="4611.78" dur="6.1">Now he says: Start being compassionate.</text><text start="4617.88" dur="9.99">And the method is, when you breathe in -- listen
carefully, it is one of the greatest methods</text><text start="4627.87" dur="10.79">-- when you breathe in, think that you are
breathing in all the miseries of all the people</text><text start="4638.66" dur="2.15">in the world.</text><text start="4640.81" dur="8.08">All the darkness, all the
negativity, all the hell that exists anywhere,</text><text start="4648.89" dur="4.88">you are breathing it in.</text><text start="4653.77" dur="6.39">And let it be absorbed
in your heart.</text><text start="4660.16" dur="6.03">You may have read or heard about the so-called
positive thinkers of the West.</text><text start="4666.19" dur="3.95">They say
just the opposite -- they don&amp;#39;t know what</text><text start="4670.14" dur="1">they are saying.</text><text start="4671.14" dur="9.5">They say, &amp;quot;When you breathe
out, throw out all your misery and negativity;</text><text start="4680.64" dur="6.98">and when you breathe in, breathe in joy,
positivity, happiness, cheerfulness.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4687.62" dur="6.741">Atisha&amp;#39;s method is just the opposite: when
you breathe in, breathe in all the misery</text><text start="4694.361" dur="3.689">and
suffering of all the beings of the world -- past,</text><text start="4698.05" dur="3.7">present and future.</text><text start="4701.75" dur="5.47">And when you breathe
out, breathe out all the joy that you have,</text><text start="4707.22" dur="6.02">all the blissfulness that you have, all the
benediction that you have.</text><text start="4713.24" dur="7.75">Breathe out, pour yourself into existence.</text><text start="4720.99" dur="6.06">This is the method
of compassion: drink in all the suffering</text><text start="4727.05" dur="5.06">and pour out all the blessings.</text><text start="4732.11" dur="3.89">And you will be surprised if you do it.</text><text start="4736" dur="2.46">The moment you take all the sufferings of
the</text><text start="4738.46" dur="8.55">world inside you, they are no longer sufferings.</text><text start="4747.01" dur="4.7">The heart immediately transforms the
energy.</text><text start="4751.71" dur="11.85">The heart is a transforming force: drink in
misery, and it is transformed into</text><text start="4763.56" dur="2.39">blissfulness... then pour it out.</text><text start="4765.95" dur="9.09">Once you have learned that your heart can
do this magic, this miracle, you would like</text><text start="4775.04" dur="2.47">to
do it again and again.</text><text start="4777.51" dur="2.44">Try it.</text><text start="4779.95" dur="9.401">It is one of the most practical methods -- simple,
and it</text><text start="4789.351" dur="2.449">brings immediate results.</text><text start="4791.8" dur="3.08">Do it today, and see.</text><text start="4794.88" dur="7.78">That is one of the approaches of Buddha and
all his disciples.</text><text start="4802.66" dur="6.94">Atisha is one of his
disciples, in the same tradition, in the same</text><text start="4809.6" dur="1.82">line.</text><text start="4811.42" dur="9.56">Buddha says again and again to his
disciples, &amp;quot;IHI PASSIKO: come and see!&amp;quot;</text><text start="4820.98" dur="2.77">They are very scientific people.</text><text start="4823.75" dur="7.69">Buddhism is
the most scientific religion on the earth;</text><text start="4831.44" dur="10.06">hence, Buddhism is gaining more and more
ground in the world every day.</text><text start="4841.5" dur="2.26">As the world becomes more intelligent, Buddha
will</text><text start="4843.76" dur="6.57">become more and more important.</text><text start="4850.33" dur="1.72">It is bound to be so.</text><text start="4852.05" dur="7.94">As more and more people come to
know about science, Buddha will have great</text><text start="4859.99" dur="5.86">appeal, because he will convince the
scientific mind -- because he says, &amp;quot;Whatsoever</text><text start="4865.85" dur="4.91">I am saying can be practiced.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4870.76" dur="3.96">And I
don&amp;#39;t say to you, &amp;quot;Believe it,&amp;quot; I say, &amp;quot;Experiment</text><text start="4874.72" dur="9.3">with it, experience it, and only then if
you feel it yourself, trust it.</text><text start="4884.02" dur="1.36">Otherwise there is no need to believe.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4885.38" dur="14.22">Try this beautiful method of compassion: take
in all the misery and pour out all the joy.</text><text start="4899.6" dur="4.48">TRAIN IN JOINING, SENDING AND TAKING TOGETHER.</text><text start="4904.08" dur="4.21">DO THIS BY RIDING
THE BREATH.</text><text start="4908.29" dur="8.9">THREE OBJECTS, THREE POISONS, THREE BASES
OF VIRTUE.</text><text start="4917.19" dur="8.62">There are three objects which can either function
as three poisons or can become three</text><text start="4925.81" dur="4.64">bases of infinite virtue.</text><text start="4930.45" dur="5.46">Atisha is talking of the inner alchemy.</text><text start="4935.91" dur="4.81">The poison can become the
nectar, the baser metal can be transformed</text><text start="4940.72" dur="2.9">into gold.</text><text start="4943.62" dur="1.69">What are these three objects?</text><text start="4945.31" dur="7.77">The first is aversion, the second is attachment,
and the third</text><text start="4953.08" dur="3.61">is indifference.</text><text start="4956.69" dur="3.93">This is how the mind functions.</text><text start="4960.62" dur="8.42">You feel aversion to whatsoever you
dislike, you feel attachment to whatsoever</text><text start="4969.04" dur="11.21">you like, and you feel indifferent to things
which you neither dislike nor like.</text><text start="4980.25" dur="6.05">These are the three objects.</text><text start="4986.3" dur="4.79">Between these three, the
mind exists.</text><text start="4991.09" dur="8.27">These are the three legs of the tripod called
the mind: aversion, attachment</text><text start="4999.36" dur="3.49">and indifference.</text><text start="5002.85" dur="9.67">And if you live in these three as they are,
you are living in poison.</text><text start="5012.52" dur="10.05">This is how we have created a hell out of
life.</text><text start="5022.57" dur="11.08">Aversion, dislike, hatred, repulsion -- that
creates one-third of your hell.</text><text start="5033.65" dur="8.93">Attachment, liking, clinging, possessiveness
-- that creates</text><text start="5042.58" dur="4.17">the second one-third of your hell.</text><text start="5046.75" dur="5.99">And indifference to all that you are neither
attracted to</text><text start="5052.74" dur="11.31">nor repulsed by -- that creates the third
part, the third one-third of your hell.</text><text start="5064.05" dur="4.31">Just watch your mind, this is how your mind
functions.</text><text start="5068.36" dur="5.76">It is always saying, &amp;quot;I like this, I
don&amp;#39;t like that, and I am indifferent to the</text><text start="5074.12" dur="2.13">third.&amp;quot;</text><text start="5076.25" dur="6.62">These are the three ways the mind goes
on moving.</text><text start="5082.87" dur="4.52">This is the rut, the routine.</text><text start="5087.39" dur="6.23">Atisha says: These are the three poisons,
but they can become the three bases of virtue.</text><text start="5093.62" dur="4">How can they become three bases of great virtue?</text><text start="5097.62" dur="9.59">If you bring in the quality of
compassion, if you learn the art of absorbing</text><text start="5107.21" dur="3.02">suffering, as if all the suffering of the
world</text><text start="5110.23" dur="12.02">is coming riding on the breath, then how can
you be repulsed?</text><text start="5122.25" dur="4.77">How can you dislike
anything and how can you be indifferent to</text><text start="5127.02" dur="2.12">anything?</text><text start="5129.14" dur="5.59">And how can you be attached to
anything?</text><text start="5134.73" dur="6.001">If you are unconditionally taking in all the
suffering in the world, drinking it,</text><text start="5140.731" dur="9.88">absorbing it in your heart, and then instead
of it pouring blessings onto the whole of</text><text start="5150.611" dur="8.989">existence unconditionally -- not to somebody
in particular, remember; not only to man</text><text start="5159.6" dur="9.88">but to all: to all beings, trees and rocks
and birds and animals, to the whole existence,</text><text start="5169.48" dur="8.34">material, immaterial -- when you are pouring
out blessings unconditionally, how can you</text><text start="5177.82" dur="1.61">be attached?</text><text start="5179.43" dur="12.84">Attachment, aversion, indifference: all disappear
with this small technique.</text><text start="5192.27" dur="2.91">And with
their disappearance the poison is transformed</text><text start="5195.18" dur="6.92">into nectar, and the bondage becomes
freedom, and the hell is no more a hell, it</text><text start="5202.1" dur="3.52">is heaven.</text><text start="5205.62" dur="10.54">In these moments you come to know: This very
body the buddha, this very earth the lotus</text><text start="5216.16" dur="4.13">paradise.</text><text start="5220.29" dur="7.84">And the last sutra:
TRAIN WITH PHRASES IN EVERY MODE OF BEHAVIOR.</text><text start="5228.13" dur="6.26">Atisha is not an escapist.</text><text start="5234.39" dur="5.44">He does not teach escapism, he does not tell
you to move from</text><text start="5239.83" dur="6.47">situations which are not to your liking.</text><text start="5246.3" dur="8.81">He says: You have to learn to function in
bodhichitta, in buddha-consciousness, in all</text><text start="5255.11" dur="3.13">kinds of situations -- in the marketplace,
in</text><text start="5258.24" dur="14.54">the monastery; with people in the crowd or
alone in a cave; with friends or with enemies;</text><text start="5272.78" dur="14.2">with family, familiar people, and with strangers;
with men and with animals.</text><text start="5286.98" dur="5.73">In all kinds
of situations, in all kinds of challenges,</text><text start="5292.71" dur="4.191">you have to learn to function in compassion,
in</text><text start="5296.901" dur="8.539">meditation -- because all these experiences
of different situations will make your</text><text start="5305.44" dur="3.85">bodhichitta more and more ripe.</text><text start="5309.29" dur="4.97">Don&amp;#39;t escape from any situation -- if you
escape, then something will remain missing</text><text start="5314.26" dur="2.33">in
you.</text><text start="5316.59" dur="9.02">Then your bodhichitta will not be that ripe,
will not be that rich.</text><text start="5325.61" dur="3.46">Live life in its
multidimensionality.</text><text start="5329.07" dur="7.91">And that&amp;#39;s what I teach you too: Live life
in its totality.</text><text start="5336.98" dur="3.81">And living in the world, don&amp;#39;t be
of it.</text><text start="5340.79" dur="7.42">Live in the world like a lotus flower in water:
it lives in water, but the water touches</text><text start="5348.21" dur="7.59">it not.</text><text start="5355.8" dur="5.32">Only then will bodhichitta flower in you,
bloom in you.</text><text start="5361.12" dur="8.11">Only then will you come
to know the ultimate consciousness which is</text><text start="5369.23" dur="4.6">freedom, which is joy, eternal joy, which
is</text><text start="5373.83" dur="1">benediction.</text><text start="5374.83" dur="14.8">Not to know it is to miss the whole point
of life; to know it </text><text start="5389.63" dur="3.71">is the only goal.</text><text start="5393.34" dur="6.99">The only goal -- remember it.</text><text start="5400.33" dur="9.77">And remember, Atisha&amp;#39;s sutras are not philosophical,
not speculative, not abstract.</text><text start="5410.1" dur="4.56">They
are experimental, they are scientific.</text><text start="5414.66" dur="11.48">Let me repeat again: religion is a science
in the sense that it is the purest knowing.</text><text start="5426.14" dur="5.41">Yet it
is not a science in the sense of chemistry</text><text start="5431.55" dur="2.37">and physics.</text><text start="5433.92" dur="6.46">It is not the science of the outward,
it is the science of the inward.</text><text start="5440.38" dur="4.36">It is not the science of the exterior, it
is the science of the</text><text start="5444.74" dur="3.14">interior.</text><text start="5447.88" dur="13.29">It is the science that takes you beyond, it
is the science that takes you into the</text><text start="5461.17" dur="5.11">unknown and the unknowable.</text><text start="5466.28" dur="2.12">It is the greatest adventure there is.</text><text start="5468.4" dur="9.57">It is a call and a
challenge to all those who have any courage,</text><text start="5477.97" dur="4.85">any guts, any intelligence.</text><text start="5482.82" dur="7.47">Religion is not for cowards, it is for people
who want to live dangerously.</text><text start="5490.29" dur="3.94">Enough for today.</text></transcript>
