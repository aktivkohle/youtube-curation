gonna have any speakers</text><text start="43.677" dur="1.168">at this event,</text><text start="45.879" dur="2.569">but I didn&amp;#39;t say Q and A&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="48.448" dur="1.035">So, we&amp;#39;re very,</text><text start="49.483" dur="3.236">super grateful that Gary
was able to join us.</text><text start="52.719" dur="3.07">Most of you, anybody
not familiar with Gary?</text><text start="55.789" dur="1.368">It&amp;#39;s a pretty tuned in audience!</text><text start="57.157" dur="1.435">- [Gary] It motivates me!</text><text start="60.394" dur="1.034">- Well yeah, there&amp;#39;s a
lot of people, obviously,</text><text start="61.428" dur="1.001">there was a little 
bit of a procession</text><text start="62.429" dur="0.834">when he was coming in,</text><text start="63.263" dur="2.169">almost like a wedding
or something like that.</text><text start="65.432" dur="2.236">Super excited, Gary&amp;#39;s here
for just a little bit.</text><text start="67.668" dur="2.202">I know he has a conference
call right around the corner,</text><text start="69.87" dur="2.402">so we&amp;#39;re just gonna go
right into a Q and A.</text><text start="72.272" dur="1.101">Gary&amp;#39;s amazing 
when it comes to rants,</text><text start="73.373" dur="2.036">it&amp;#39;s funny how I actually
decided on Gary.</text><text start="75.409" dur="2.702">We did a comedian in year
two of Mastermind Talks,</text><text start="78.111" dur="1.035">during a dinner.</text><text start="79.146" dur="1.601">And it was so well received,</text><text start="80.747" dur="2.069">and I was like, man it&amp;#39;s be
great to have like a comedian</text><text start="82.816" dur="3.871">who actually could deliver
great business stuff,</text><text start="86.687" dur="1.768">and I was like fuck, 
Gary&amp;#39;s hilarious!</text><text start="88.455" dur="1.768">So, that&amp;#39;s why 
we have Gary here.</text><text start="90.223" dur="2.236">So, ladies and gentlemen,
no introduction needed,</text><text start="92.459" dur="1.235">Gary Vaynerchuk!</text><text start="93.694" dur="1.067">(applause)</text><text start="94.761" dur="1.001">- Thank you.</text><text start="97.364" dur="0.834">Thank you.</text><text start="99.399" dur="1.235">Super pumped to be here.</text><text start="100.634" dur="2.569">Obviously a lot of friends
that I know intimately,</text><text start="103.203" dur="2.402">so that makes it a lot of fun.</text><text start="105.605" dur="3.07">Yeah, you know, 
obviously a lot of</text><text start="108.675" dur="1.969">what I&amp;#39;ve been focused on
for the last couple years</text><text start="110.644" dur="3.804">has been to 
actually push my brand</text><text start="114.448" dur="1.768">into a place where 
I could go to an event</text><text start="116.216" dur="1.769">and just do Q and A.</text><text start="117.985" dur="2.068">Which I think 
at the end of the day,</text><text start="120.053" dur="2.67">knowing so many of you,</text><text start="122.723" dur="2.435">I&amp;#39;m and will always be concerned</text><text start="125.158" dur="1.735">about can I bore people?</text><text start="126.893" dur="1.302">Can it become boring?</text><text start="128.195" dur="2.969">And there&amp;#39;s a lot of
you that really know me,</text><text start="131.164" dur="3.904">the truth is there&amp;#39;s so
few things I believe in.</text><text start="135.068" dur="2.97">There&amp;#39;s really only three
or four true kind of like</text><text start="138.038" dur="2.002">principles that I believe in.</text><text start="140.04" dur="2.536">Luckily for me, and
luckily for so many of us,</text><text start="142.576" dur="3.069">we got to live during this
era where everything changes</text><text start="145.645" dur="1.068">so much.</text><text start="146.713" dur="3.771">I&amp;#39;m baffled by people not
understanding what happens</text><text start="150.484" dur="3.303">when we move 
to a Snapchat universe,</text><text start="153.787" dur="2.736">all the same shit that happened
on every other platform</text><text start="156.523" dur="1.301">that had people&amp;#39;s attention,</text><text start="157.824" dur="3.37">whether it&amp;#39;s print or radio,
television, or Facebook,</text><text start="161.194" dur="4.205">so for me, thank God that
the markets gonna move</text><text start="165.399" dur="4.204">on an everyday basis and
thank God people get old.</text><text start="169.603" dur="1.802">And what I mean 
by people getting old</text><text start="171.405" dur="2.769">is at South by Southwest 
it was funny.</text><text start="174.174" dur="4.304">Chris Sacca exposed this thing
in his big Vanity Fair piece,</text><text start="178.478" dur="1.235">which we make fun of,</text><text start="179.713" dur="2.002">but for years we had 
this very small group</text><text start="181.715" dur="2.402">that at South-by would get
together at like midnight</text><text start="184.117" dur="2.236">and go in literally
just a small hotel room,</text><text start="186.353" dur="2.302">just sit there 
and we would basically,</text><text start="188.655" dur="2.603">we called it the jam session, 
all it was was</text><text start="191.258" dur="3.17">literally &amp;quot;Is Pinterest
worth a billion dollars?&amp;quot;</text><text start="194.428" dur="1.935">&amp;quot;What do you think is
gonna happen with Uber?&amp;quot;</text><text start="196.363" dur="1.401">and we did that for 
seven or eight years,</text><text start="197.764" dur="1.568">it was really interesting
to see where people</text><text start="199.332" dur="1.502">were right and wrong,</text><text start="200.834" dur="2.436">and it was just amazing
debates and I learned so much.</text><text start="203.27" dur="2.636">But to me the 
Q and A and the banter</text><text start="205.906" dur="3.036">and the content 
is so imperative.</text><text start="208.942" dur="2.87">It was two years ago at the
jam session where literally</text><text start="211.812" dur="2.769">the founders, 
the founders of Twitter</text><text start="214.581" dur="4.171">and Instagram and these
tools poo-poohed Snapchat.</text><text start="219.92" dur="3.17">And like just really, 
it was crazy.</text><text start="223.09" dur="1.768">I was literally emphatically
yelling at them,</text><text start="224.858" dur="3.37">like you guys changed
the world, and everybody</text><text start="228.228" dur="2.135">said the same shit about
your product five years ago,</text><text start="230.363" dur="1.602">how did you get so old so fast?</text><text start="231.965" dur="1.001">(audience laughs)</text><text start="232.966" dur="3.937">And so you know, obviously
whether it&amp;#39;s entrepreneurship</text><text start="236.903" dur="2.136">or investing or 
running a company,</text><text start="239.039" dur="2.869">I think for the people here
that have had the time,</text><text start="241.908" dur="1.835">&amp;#39;cause I know some 
of you are so busy,</text><text start="243.743" dur="2.103">in the last six months to a
year I&amp;#39;ve been spending a lot</text><text start="245.846" dur="4.237">more time on what really
has allowed me the privilege</text><text start="250.083" dur="1.702">of standing in 
front of you which is,</text><text start="251.785" dur="3.003">I&amp;#39;m not really IQ strong,
I&amp;#39;m really probably,</text><text start="254.788" dur="2.169">I would actually argue 
that I&amp;#39;m probably</text><text start="256.957" dur="2.669">below-average to average on IQ,</text><text start="259.626" dur="5.105">but I do think my parents
blessed me with over-the-top EQ,</text><text start="264.731" dur="3.17">and my emotional intelligence
and self-awareness and</text><text start="267.901" dur="2.436">empathy and the way 
I built my, you know,</text><text start="270.337" dur="2.869">the reason VaynerMedia has
gone from 30 to 650 people</text><text start="273.206" dur="3.237">and hasn&amp;#39;t broke is
predicated so much on EQ.</text><text start="276.443" dur="2.035">And then consumer behavior,</text><text start="278.478" dur="2.336">like projecting what 
I think you guys are gonna do</text><text start="280.814" dur="1.902">before you realize 
you&amp;#39;re gonna do it,</text><text start="282.716" dur="2.002">has a little bit to do
with that stuff as well.</text><text start="284.718" dur="2.936">So, thrilled to go anywhere,</text><text start="287.654" dur="2.636">I&amp;#39;m real excited to do Q and
A and thanks for having me.</text><text start="290.29" dur="1.335">Are you guys gonna mic it?</text><text start="291.625" dur="0.834">You gonna run it?</text><text start="292.459" dur="0.834">Great.</text><text start="293.293" dur="2.436">Let&amp;#39;s just get into it.</text><text start="295.729" dur="1.535">Just name and question.</text><text start="297.264" dur="1.468">- [Cameron] Cameron Herold, 
I&amp;#39;ve got a question</text><text start="298.732" dur="1.034">regarding second in command.</text><text start="299.766" dur="2.002">I ran a session today about
your Chief Operating Officer.</text><text start="301.768" dur="1.769">I wanna know who is
running VaynerMedia for you</text><text start="303.537" dur="1.234">and what makes the relationship</text><text start="304.771" dur="2.236">between you and 
that person so strong.</text><text start="307.007" dur="2.169">- So that&amp;#39;s an 
interesting question,</text><text start="309.176" dur="1.701">and an interesting time
to ask that question.</text><text start="310.877" dur="3.537">This Friday, my brother
A.J. who&amp;#39;s been the C.O.O.</text><text start="314.414" dur="1.602">of VaynerMedia 
from the beginning</text><text start="316.016" dur="1.067">is leaving the company.</text><text start="317.083" dur="2.87">I think some of you might
have read a month ago</text><text start="319.953" dur="1.268">AJ finally announced,</text><text start="321.221" dur="1.401">cause he&amp;#39;s been 
very private about it,</text><text start="322.622" dur="3.404">my brother has Crohn&amp;#39;s Disease.</text><text start="326.026" dur="3.136">And truth is, and I know
some of you know AJ,</text><text start="329.162" dur="1.368">AJ and I are really different,</text><text start="330.53" dur="1.969">just like I&amp;#39;m much more,</text><text start="332.499" dur="3.003">I mean AJ is thrilled
to have his seven friends</text><text start="335.502" dur="3.737">and I&amp;#39;m desperate 
to be deep friends</text><text start="339.239" dur="1.935">with every fucking 
person in here.</text><text start="341.174" dur="1.368">(laughter)</text><text start="342.542" dur="3.27">And so AJ was no question</text><text start="345.812" dur="3.103">the C.O.O. of the company,</text><text start="348.915" dur="2.736">for the first five or six years.</text><text start="351.651" dur="2.269">Over the last year and a
half we knew this was coming</text><text start="353.92" dur="2.436">so we commoditized him out.</text><text start="356.356" dur="2.236">There&amp;#39;s a guy by the 
name of James Orsini,</text><text start="358.592" dur="4.137">who ran for 25 years ran big
agencies, Satchi and Satchi</text><text start="362.729" dur="1.768">and things of that nature.</text><text start="364.497" dur="1.168">You know the truth is and</text><text start="365.665" dur="1.335">something I&amp;#39;ve been 
talking a lot</text><text start="367" dur="3.904">about with my own friends,
not as much publicly,</text><text start="370.904" dur="2.569">maybe John knows, very few
people know this in this room,</text><text start="373.473" dur="1.268">maybe one or two,</text><text start="374.741" dur="3.437">I really run VaynerMedia.</text><text start="378.178" dur="4.104">Like I think because I play
GaryVee as my side hustle,</text><text start="383.783" dur="1.936">and because I&amp;#39;m good at it,</text><text start="385.719" dur="2.502">and because I work 
18 hours a day,</text><text start="388.221" dur="2.836">a far majority in this room,
including people like Dale,</text><text start="391.057" dur="1.068">like people at Yanek,</text><text start="392.125" dur="3.27">like people I really know, 
I don&amp;#39;t think really understand</text><text start="395.395" dur="1.869">how much I actually 
operate the business.</text><text start="397.264" dur="2.569">And so,</text><text start="399.833" dur="3.837">for me, every operational</text><text start="403.67" dur="2.369">decision runs through me,</text><text start="406.039" dur="3.136">I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of
context on it, I&amp;#39;m there.</text><text start="409.175" dur="1.936">And I think the key,</text><text start="411.111" dur="2.235">and I&amp;#39;d be curious and we
can maybe talk afterwards,</text><text start="413.346" dur="2.836">I think the key for me
in having a number two,</text><text start="416.182" dur="3.904">or number three, is less
about them running it</text><text start="420.086" dur="1.602">in the way that you framed it,</text><text start="421.688" dur="0.834">it&amp;#39;s more about them</text><text start="422.522" dur="2.836">complimenting the things
that you&amp;#39;re not good at.</text><text start="425.358" dur="3.404">Like, I&amp;#39;m very self-aware.
Right?</text><text start="428.762" dur="4.437">For example, knowing that
20% of you, a lot of you</text><text start="433.199" dur="2.002">don&amp;#39;t know me, but knowing
the ones that know me</text><text start="435.201" dur="2.87">knowing that 20% of
you didn&amp;#39;t even like me</text><text start="438.071" dur="2.269">on first impression 
at a conference</text><text start="440.34" dur="0.968">or things of that nature,</text><text start="441.308" dur="1.501">like self-awareness 
is imperative.</text><text start="442.809" dur="2.769">And as an operator, 
I&amp;#39;m very self-aware</text><text start="445.578" dur="2.737">and I know where my
short-comings are.</text><text start="448.315" dur="4.27">And so I think for anybody
here that&amp;#39;s looking to scale,</text><text start="452.585" dur="4.238">I think there&amp;#39;s way too much
pride in this collective room,</text><text start="456.823" dur="2.135">like nobody here is 
good at everything.</text><text start="458.958" dur="1.235">And that&amp;#39;s super real.</text><text start="460.193" dur="0.968">And I think we all know that.</text><text start="461.161" dur="2.202">And we have strengths and
weaknesses and I think,</text><text start="463.363" dur="1.301">I&amp;#39;ve been a guy,</text><text start="464.664" dur="3.47">and I&amp;#39;ve watched a lot of
companies do this at scale,</text><text start="468.134" dur="3.103">I really believe on tripling
down in your strengths.</text><text start="471.237" dur="3.237">I do not, I&amp;#39;m not a big fan
on working on your weaknesses.</text><text start="474.474" dur="3.37">I think you have to be
dangerous in your weaknesses,</text><text start="477.844" dur="3.303">like I&amp;#39;m not a dope when
it comes to the finances</text><text start="481.147" dur="1.936">or the other things 
that I don&amp;#39;t wanna do,</text><text start="483.083" dur="2.035">but I&amp;#39;m far from 
being interested</text><text start="485.118" dur="2.035">in being world-class in it,</text><text start="487.153" dur="0.935">It just doesn&amp;#39;t leave 
enough room</text><text start="488.088" dur="2.269">for you to be world-class at
what comes natural to you,</text><text start="490.357" dur="3.003">which is always 
gonna have more upside.</text><text start="493.36" dur="2.068">So, it&amp;#39;s been AJ, 
it&amp;#39;s gonna be James,</text><text start="495.428" dur="1.035">I&amp;#39;m building something else,</text><text start="496.463" dur="1.935">I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;m sure
a lot of you that have</text><text start="498.398" dur="2.169">bigger organizations if you&amp;#39;re
not in a solo entrepreneur</text><text start="500.567" dur="2.035">land and if you&amp;#39;ve 
run companies,</text><text start="502.602" dur="1.802">one of the things that 
I realize and I realize I did at</text><text start="504.404" dur="2.803">Wine Library and I&amp;#39;m gonna make
it official at VaynerMedia,</text><text start="507.207" dur="4.471">is I&amp;#39;m gonna create something
called Office of the CEO.</text><text start="511.678" dur="3.136">So there&amp;#39;s gonna be these six
people and they&amp;#39;re my family,</text><text start="514.814" dur="1.635">they&amp;#39;re the inner circle,
they&amp;#39;re the people</text><text start="516.449" dur="2.036">that nobody else in the
company tells anything to</text><text start="518.485" dur="1.034">because they know that
the second they tell them</text><text start="519.519" dur="1.835">they&amp;#39;re gonna tell me, right?</text><text start="521.354" dur="1.702">Everybody&amp;#39;s got 
that inner circle,</text><text start="523.056" dur="1.068">and by the way,</text><text start="524.124" dur="2.402">some of them are ranked
number five in the company,</text><text start="526.526" dur="4.505">and another person might
be number 174 salary level,</text><text start="531.031" dur="1.134">so now I&amp;#39;m gonna 
make it official</text><text start="532.165" dur="1.902">because they just help me scale.</text><text start="534.067" dur="1.568">When there&amp;#39;s 
that level of trust,</text><text start="535.635" dur="2.469">I think sometimes people
silo a level of trust</text><text start="538.104" dur="2.937">just to your right-hand
woman, right-hand man,</text><text start="541.041" dur="1.267">like one or two people,</text><text start="542.308" dur="1.802">I actually am looking for scale,</text><text start="544.11" dur="3.103">and so I&amp;#39;m gonna build
a five, six person team</text><text start="547.213" dur="2.303">that basically is just
gonna take care of the thing</text><text start="549.516" dur="1.701">that&amp;#39;s the most important 
to me right now.</text><text start="551.217" dur="3.671">Like we just landed one of the
biggest banks in the country.</text><text start="554.888" dur="0.934">I can&amp;#39;t even announce it yet.</text><text start="555.822" dur="1.468">One of the biggest 
banks in the country,</text><text start="557.29" dur="1.602">it&amp;#39;s gonna be 30% 
of our revenue,</text><text start="558.892" dur="1.968">it&amp;#39;s an enormously big client,</text><text start="560.86" dur="1.835">I really need to make 
sure it goes well.</text><text start="562.695" dur="1.168">I need to put everything on it</text><text start="563.863" dur="2.236">besides the great 
team I put on it.</text><text start="566.099" dur="0.967">So they&amp;#39;ll keep an eye on that.</text><text start="567.066" dur="1.602">And they&amp;#39;ll keep an eye
on this one employee</text><text start="568.668" dur="2.269">that I think is a superstar
and they&amp;#39;re gonna vet it,</text><text start="570.937" dur="3.103">so the other thing I would
give a recommendation to</text><text start="574.04" dur="2.369">that has I think thematics
into were you&amp;#39;re going,</text><text start="576.409" dur="3.57">is building an inner circle
that everybody in the company</text><text start="579.979" dur="1.469">knows is you.</text><text start="581.448" dur="1.434">Just even the five people</text><text start="582.882" dur="1.802">within an organization 
in that group</text><text start="584.684" dur="1.935">won&amp;#39;t even have 
a title within it.</text><text start="586.619" dur="1.735">It&amp;#39;s just gonna be, 
that&amp;#39;s what they are.</text><text start="588.354" dur="1.001">Office of the CEO.</text><text start="589.355" dur="3.471">Something to consider that
I see a lot of value in.</text><text start="592.826" dur="3.403">Thanks for your question, man.</text><text start="596.229" dur="1.235">- [David] Dude, David Osborne
I was born in Austin--</text><text start="597.464" dur="1.234">- Are you literally that lazy?</text><text start="598.698" dur="0.934">You just...</text><text start="600.533" dur="2.036">You couldn&amp;#39;t go there?
(laughing audience)</text><text start="602.569" dur="1.434">- [David] Gotta 
sit up front.</text><text start="604.003" dur="1.635">- Just gonna stay up here.</text><text start="605.638" dur="2.937">- [David] So...
(laughing audience)</text><text start="608.575" dur="1.534">Dude, I was born 
in Austin, Texas.</text><text start="610.109" dur="0.835">Two questions:</text><text start="610.944" dur="2.435">One, what the fuck is Snapchat?</text><text start="613.379" dur="1.802">Man, I got on it because
you told me to get on it,</text><text start="615.181" dur="1.201">and I still don&amp;#39;t know 
what the fuck it is</text><text start="616.382" dur="1.502">or why I&amp;#39;m on it!
(laughing audience)</text><text start="617.884" dur="1.168">I know a lot of young 
people follow me,</text><text start="619.052" dur="0.901">and I got no idea why--</text><text start="619.953" dur="2.002">- [Gary] That&amp;#39;s a very common
marketers&amp;#39; question right now.</text><text start="621.955" dur="0.934">- The second one 
is what you invest</text><text start="622.889" dur="1.868">in outside of VaynerMedia.</text><text start="624.757" dur="1.869">Do you put money in
anything that cash flows</text><text start="626.626" dur="1.235">or anything like that?</text><text start="627.861" dur="1.267">- [Gary] Got it, so...</text><text start="631.03" dur="2.269">I&amp;#39;ll answer second one,
because it&amp;#39;s very detailed.</text><text start="633.299" dur="1.902">I had a $25 million</text><text start="635.201" dur="1.936">venture fund called Vayner/RSE.</text><text start="637.137" dur="2.469">I&amp;#39;m closing one 
called Vayner Capital,</text><text start="639.606" dur="2.135">that I&amp;#39;ll be announcing
in the next month or so.</text><text start="641.741" dur="3.303">It&amp;#39;s gonna be a $55 to 
70 million fund, very different.</text><text start="645.044" dur="5.272">Vayner/RSE was 25 million,
when I made 100 investments.</text><text start="650.316" dur="1.168">So a lot of different things,</text><text start="651.484" dur="2.503">more angel investing 
like I used to do.</text><text start="653.987" dur="2.669">This new one I&amp;#39;m gonna
raise 50 to probably</text><text start="656.656" dur="1.602">end up being 60, 
70 million dollars.</text><text start="658.258" dur="2.736">I&amp;#39;m probably only gonna
invest in 10 companies.</text><text start="660.994" dur="1.334">So it&amp;#39;s going to be 
much later stage,</text><text start="662.328" dur="2.603">and I&amp;#39;m use VaynerMedia
and its capabilities</text><text start="664.931" dur="3.17">to help the outcome of companies
that are further along.</text><text start="668.101" dur="1.935">So I&amp;#39;ve always Angel--</text><text start="670.036" dur="3.67">I&amp;#39;ve made up net net 
between Wine Library,</text><text start="673.706" dur="1.302">which has been a very 
successful business</text><text start="675.008" dur="2.168">for a very long time,
that I get income from</text><text start="677.176" dur="2.603">&amp;#39;cause I ran it and 
it&amp;#39;s family business,</text><text start="679.779" dur="3.804">Vayner, I get seven 
figure book advances,</text><text start="683.583" dur="2.202">and I get paid 
six figures to speak.</text><text start="685.785" dur="2.269">Like with all that
lucrativeness,</text><text start="688.054" dur="1.502">the investment in Uber</text><text start="689.556" dur="3.37">and Twitter and Facebook
and Tumblr and Buddy Media</text><text start="692.926" dur="3.77">those are gonna end up
making me the most money.</text><text start="696.696" dur="2.503">So that&amp;#39;s what I do.</text><text start="700.266" dur="2.169">And then, but...</text><text start="702.435" dur="2.669">I really truly see 
myself as an operator.</text><text start="705.104" dur="2.703">You know, I will never 
not run a business.</text><text start="707.807" dur="1.535">At scale, by the way.</text><text start="709.342" dur="0.834">I&amp;#39;ll never--</text><text start="710.176" dur="2.136">And this is a fun thing
to say in this room,</text><text start="712.312" dur="2.168">I will never be 
GaryVee full-time.</text><text start="714.48" dur="1.635">Like, even though
it&amp;#39;s gotten to a place,</text><text start="716.115" dur="1.402">and it&amp;#39;s starting 
to get to a place</text><text start="717.517" dur="3.003">where I think I can make a
lotta lotta money doing it,</text><text start="720.52" dur="3.87">I just really enjoy 
running businesses.</text><text start="724.39" dur="2.703">Snapchat is very simple.</text><text start="727.093" dur="3.737">I mean, it&amp;#39;s just
attention arbitrage, right?</text><text start="730.83" dur="1.235">It&amp;#39;s...</text><text start="732.065" dur="1.468">It&amp;#39;s a platform that people are</text><text start="733.533" dur="1.468">consuming their content from.</text><text start="735.001" dur="1.902">There&amp;#39;s nothing else to say.</text><text start="736.903" dur="1.234">The stories,</text><text start="738.137" dur="1.302">have you gotten to a point
where you understand--</text><text start="739.439" dur="1.835">That&amp;#39;s the newsfeed.</text><text start="741.274" dur="1.435">It just looks a 
little bit different.</text><text start="742.709" dur="0.901">You know, it&amp;#39;s interesting.</text><text start="743.61" dur="1.501">If you take your phone right now</text><text start="745.111" dur="1.635">and look at 
every social network:</text><text start="746.746" dur="3.003">Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn--
if you consider it that,</text><text start="749.749" dur="1.001">Pinterest...</text><text start="751.651" dur="2.269">Like if you literally put all</text><text start="753.92" dur="1.501">seven of the things 
we group up with:</text><text start="755.421" dur="2.836">Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Pinterest, Instagram</text><text start="758.257" dur="2.336">They all, functionally, 
are the same.</text><text start="760.593" dur="2.903">It&amp;#39;s basically one
hardcore piece of content,</text><text start="763.496" dur="3.303">and then social commentary
in one shape or form,</text><text start="766.799" dur="1.435">and then you just go this way.</text><text start="768.234" dur="2.202">Snapchat has been 
the most confusing,</text><text start="770.436" dur="2.803">&amp;#39;cause it had totally
different UI/UX experience</text><text start="773.239" dur="3.604">left and right, up and
down, very confusing.</text><text start="776.843" dur="1.768">What&amp;#39;s interesting
though, on the flip side,</text><text start="778.611" dur="1.668">is if we were to go</text><text start="780.279" dur="1.836">and I&amp;#39;m actually thinking
about making this video,</text><text start="782.115" dur="2.869">because I&amp;#39;ve just realized
this through friends and family</text><text start="784.984" dur="3.07">that are what I call
normals, not in our world.</text><text start="788.054" dur="2.502">Just like kids I went to
high school with, right?</text><text start="790.556" dur="3.704">If you go to 
Times Square right now,</text><text start="794.26" dur="2.903">and you give 20 people Snapchat,</text><text start="797.163" dur="1.235">that have never used it,</text><text start="798.398" dur="2.669">within an hour, 
if you help them,</text><text start="801.067" dur="2.936">within an hour, 
they really understand it.</text><text start="804.003" dur="1.769">And just to give you context,</text><text start="805.772" dur="2.602">that never happened 
with Twitter.</text><text start="808.374" dur="2.436">As somebody whose grown
up in the last 10 years,</text><text start="810.81" dur="3.136">normals never fully
fully understood Twitter,</text><text start="813.946" dur="3.304">and they really 
understand Snapchat,</text><text start="817.25" dur="1.435">and they&amp;#39;re addicted to it.</text><text start="818.685" dur="1.635">And so...</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.37">Just another place for
people to create content.</text><text start="823.69" dur="0.834">You know.</text><text start="824.524" dur="1.434">I think the bigger thing--</text><text start="825.958" dur="1.402">The reason I&amp;#39;m so bullish on it</text><text start="827.36" dur="1.768">and the reason in 
December and January</text><text start="829.128" dur="1.535">I got very loud about it,</text><text start="830.663" dur="2.069">even though I&amp;#39;ve been talking
about it for two years,</text><text start="832.732" dur="5.505">is DJ Khaled was the cherry
on top of understanding,</text><text start="838.237" dur="2.57">and we kinda started talking
about a Vayner in September,</text><text start="840.807" dur="1.101">&amp;quot;shit.&amp;quot;</text><text start="841.908" dur="3.97">30, 40 year olds are starting
to use this and for real,</text><text start="845.878" dur="2.303">and this is how they all go,</text><text start="849.148" dur="3.17">either they start in a
tech-nerd environment</text><text start="852.318" dur="2.102">or a kid environment, right?</text><text start="854.42" dur="1.669">Then they bubble up,</text><text start="856.089" dur="2.969">and then the first thing you&amp;#39;ll
notice is 30 to 40-year-olds</text><text start="859.058" dur="3.003">in New York, San Francisco,
and L.A using it,</text><text start="862.061" dur="2.202">and then that will happen in
the middle of the country.</text><text start="864.263" dur="1.669">And then it&amp;#39;ll 
go 40, 50, 60, 70.</text><text start="865.932" dur="3.203">Snapchat&amp;#39;s already bigger than
every other social network</text><text start="869.135" dur="2.869">that&amp;#39;s come before it,
except for Facebook.</text><text start="872.004" dur="1.469">Already, right now.</text><text start="873.473" dur="1.101">Instagram, yes,</text><text start="874.574" dur="1.801">but Instagram&amp;#39;s such a weird
one cause it got bought</text><text start="876.375" dur="2.536">500 days into its lifecycle.</text><text start="878.911" dur="3.07">And so it got vigged 
so much by Facebook.</text><text start="881.981" dur="0.834">And so...</text><text start="884.283" dur="1.435">It&amp;#39;s just an important 
place man.</text><text start="885.718" dur="3.404">I, for this room, there&amp;#39;s no
more important place right now</text><text start="889.122" dur="2.869">to figure out how to story
tell and do what you do.</text><text start="891.991" dur="4.204">How you communicate, what you
sell, except contextually,</text><text start="896.195" dur="0.834">you have to figure out how</text><text start="897.029" dur="2.503">that works in a 
Snapchat environment.</text><text start="899.532" dur="2.135">Because the biggest fear
I have for people that are</text><text start="901.667" dur="3.671">entrepreneurs, growth hackers,
smart, doing their thing,</text><text start="905.338" dur="3.437">is we&amp;#39;re going to not
a mobile first world.</text><text start="908.775" dur="2.836">We&amp;#39;re going to a 
mobile only world.</text><text start="911.611" dur="3.003">Right, like, I&amp;#39;m on a three-day
business trip right now.</text><text start="914.614" dur="2.469">No laptop, this is it.</text><text start="917.083" dur="1.401">That blows my mind.</text><text start="918.484" dur="3.904">Like, that&amp;#39;s just crazy to me,</text><text start="922.388" dur="1.101">that I don&amp;#39;t have my laptop.</text><text start="923.489" dur="1.468">I&amp;#39;m running business-- 
like I do stuff!</text><text start="924.957" dur="1.235">This is not like, you know,</text><text start="926.192" dur="0.834">and so</text><text start="927.994" dur="1.201">there&amp;#39;s a lot of 
people here that</text><text start="929.195" dur="2.135">rely on their tactics
in a digital environment</text><text start="931.33" dur="2.57">based on 
landing page optimization</text><text start="933.9" dur="1.401">and all the things 
they think about</text><text start="935.301" dur="1.835">in a desktop universe.</text><text start="938.571" dur="1.335">And so</text><text start="939.906" dur="1.701">A, what you&amp;#39;re 
doing on your website</text><text start="941.607" dur="1.368">and how you&amp;#39;re 
storytelling to the world,</text><text start="942.975" dur="1.602">you have to figure 
out mobile only</text><text start="944.577" dur="2.202">and B, and probably 
more importantly,</text><text start="946.779" dur="3.837">as you guys know, it&amp;#39;s being
contextual and relevant</text><text start="950.616" dur="1.702">in all these other channels,</text><text start="952.318" dur="3.504">as well as being relevant
in your home base.</text><text start="955.822" dur="1.835">And so, that&amp;#39;s that...</text><text start="959.058" dur="1.301">(microphone)</text><text start="960.359" dur="1.902">- [Zach] Hey Gary, 
my name is Zach Obront.</text><text start="962.261" dur="2.469">Question is, I&amp;#39;ve heard you
mention before</text><text start="964.73" dur="4.572">that you think of VaynerMedia
as 650 people to leverage you.</text><text start="969.302" dur="3.169">- Yes, the scalable version 
of my marketing talent, yes.</text><text start="972.471" dur="2.536">- [Zach] What&amp;#39;s the 
thinking both from</text><text start="975.007" dur="2.169">a why perspective and a how
perspective of doing that</text><text start="977.176" dur="2.269">versus the most 
typical agency model</text><text start="979.445" dur="1.502">of trying to remove yourself</text><text start="980.947" dur="2.202">or make it more
self-sufficient without you?</text><text start="983.149" dur="1.868">- Well it is self-sufficient
without me.</text><text start="985.017" dur="1.101">And why don&amp;#39;t you hold
don&amp;#39;t you hold the mic</text><text start="986.118" dur="0.935">because there might 
be a detail here.</text><text start="987.053" dur="0.6">- [Zach] Yeah.</text><text start="987.653" dur="2.169">- It&amp;#39;s fully self-sufficient
without me.</text><text start="989.822" dur="2.403">I think, again in the same
way as your first question,</text><text start="992.225" dur="3.169">I always think the
paradox of how I run shit</text><text start="995.394" dur="2.136">and what I&amp;#39;m excited 
about to keep you</text><text start="997.53" dur="2.135">interested for 10, 20, 30 years</text><text start="999.665" dur="3.204">Most of what it looks
like is going on isn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="1002.869" dur="3.77">I think you&amp;#39;d be very
fascinated by the fact that,</text><text start="1006.639" dur="0.834">I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="1007.473" dur="1.435">of the 100 million dollars in</text><text start="1008.908" dur="1.668">revenue from 
VaynerMedia will do this year,</text><text start="1010.576" dur="2.67">60 or 70 of it has 
almost has nothing,</text><text start="1013.246" dur="1.568">like I don&amp;#39;t even 
know the client.</text><text start="1014.814" dur="0.834">Nothing.</text><text start="1015.648" dur="1.935">They&amp;#39;re not buying 
Gary Vaynerchuk,</text><text start="1017.583" dur="3.137">of course once in a while
they may think that,</text><text start="1020.72" dur="2.435">but we&amp;#39;re very clear
that this is an agency.</text><text start="1023.155" dur="4.138">So it&amp;#39;s very 
self-sufficient without me.</text><text start="1027.293" dur="2.636">But why it&amp;#39;s the scalable
version of me</text><text start="1029.929" dur="3.27">is the craft that 
the agency is doing.</text><text start="1033.199" dur="3.036">Meaning we&amp;#39;re leaving a ton
of fucking money on the table,</text><text start="1036.235" dur="3.17">by not doing banner ads,
by not doing search,</text><text start="1039.405" dur="1.735">by not doing a ton of shit.</text><text start="1041.14" dur="2.536">We probably left $25 million</text><text start="1043.676" dur="1.768">straight up on the table,</text><text start="1045.444" dur="3.737">by not wanting 
to build websites.</text><text start="1049.181" dur="1.702">When I say it&amp;#39;s a 
scalable version of me,</text><text start="1050.883" dur="3.037">my main plan seven years
ago was, how am I gonna buy-</text><text start="1053.92" dur="3.069">As I started meeting 
Zucks and Travis and stuff,</text><text start="1056.989" dur="2.636">I was like, 
&amp;quot;Fuck I&amp;#39;m not these guys.</text><text start="1059.625" dur="1.869">&amp;quot;This is not who I am.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1061.494" dur="1.568">And back to 
self-awareness, I&amp;#39;m like,</text><text start="1063.062" dur="1.368">so I&amp;#39;m not gonna make my money</text><text start="1064.43" dur="1.835">the way they&amp;#39;re 
gonna make their money.</text><text start="1066.265" dur="3.07">Seven years ago, I&amp;#39;m like,
&amp;quot;How am I gonna buy the Jets?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1069.335" dur="4.237">Right, and so...
(laughing)</text><text start="1073.572" dur="3.838">I decided that what I was
better at than all of them</text><text start="1077.41" dur="4.137">was I could sell shit
better than them and stuff.</text><text start="1081.547" dur="2.636">And then I kinda gave it a
lot of thought for a year,</text><text start="1084.183" dur="1.168">and I said, &amp;quot;Huh.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1085.351" dur="1.735">There&amp;#39;s this guy by the
name of Dean Metropoulos,</text><text start="1087.086" dur="1.201">he&amp;#39;s just a private equity guy,</text><text start="1088.287" dur="1.201">but he did something 
that I believe in.</text><text start="1089.488" dur="2.136">I&amp;#39;m a very big believer

not like, you know.</text><text start="1328.294" dur="2.302">And so, I just started 
talking to myself,</text><text start="1330.596" dur="1.635">I talk to myself a lot,</text><text start="1332.231" dur="2.602">and I was like, 
I need to address this.</text><text start="1334.833" dur="3.07">So that&amp;#39;s what I said, and
then the flight&amp;#39;s delayed.</text><text start="1337.903" dur="2.77">Super funny, it happens, 
no big deal.</text><text start="1340.673" dur="1.535">And I&amp;#39;m just talking and
talking, and I was like</text><text start="1342.208" dur="4.537">you know what, when 
I turned 30, I freaked my shit</text><text start="1346.745" dur="2.503">with Wine Library and 
I started Wine Library TV</text><text start="1349.248" dur="3.27">and got into tech and I
completely changed my behavior.</text><text start="1352.518" dur="1.568">On my 30th birthday.</text><text start="1354.086" dur="3.103">Driving to Wine Library,
looking in my rear view mirror,</text><text start="1357.189" dur="2.202">I&amp;#39;m like, literally this is
what happened, my birthday,</text><text start="1359.391" dur="1.602">my 30th birthday, 
I looked at myself dead</text><text start="1360.993" dur="2.536">in the mirror, in my rear
view mirror, and I said</text><text start="1363.529" dur="2.436">&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re fuckin&amp;#39; full of shit.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1365.965" dur="1.334">and what I would say to myself,</text><text start="1367.299" dur="1.802">talking to myself I was like,</text><text start="1369.101" dur="2.336">you say that you&amp;#39;re gonna
buy the New York Jets,</text><text start="1371.437" dur="4.237">none of your behavior
maps you pulling that off.</text><text start="1375.674" dur="2.736">And so if you&amp;#39;re gonna do
it, you better lay down</text><text start="1378.41" dur="3.27">some serious foundation
from 30 to 40 because</text><text start="1381.68" dur="4.238">family&amp;#39;s coming and all this,
right, so I said to myself,</text><text start="1385.918" dur="2.836">&amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be romantic
if on my 40th birthday,</text><text start="1388.754" dur="1.568">&amp;quot;because I don&amp;#39;t think 
I need another,</text><text start="1390.322" dur="4.004">&amp;quot;what am I gonna work,
from 19 hours a day to 24?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1394.326" dur="1.769">I was like, that&amp;#39;s not
gonna be it, I was like,</text><text start="1396.095" dur="1.535">you know what, health.</text><text start="1397.63" dur="1.635">That&amp;#39;d be a really 
good one to address,</text><text start="1399.265" dur="1.701">let me get my 
shit together there</text><text start="1400.966" dur="2.603">and literally before 
the flight took over,</text><text start="1403.569" dur="3.37">I said, &amp;#39;cause I was
38 and four months old,</text><text start="1406.939" dur="4.004">I was like, fuck it, 
why wait &amp;#39;till 40?</text><text start="1410.943" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;ll do it at 39.</text><text start="1414.213" dur="2.002">And then, literally, 
I was like you know what,</text><text start="1416.215" dur="2.636">fuck it, I&amp;#39;ll do it 
as soon as possible.</text><text start="1418.851" dur="4.004">And so that happened 
about a year and a half</text><text start="1422.855" dur="2.169">after we met</text><text start="1425.024" dur="4.504">where I tried my first version
of what I just told you,</text><text start="1429.528" dur="3.47">which was I decided to go
the peer pressure route,</text><text start="1432.998" dur="3.137">and I publicly Tweeted and
Facebooked that I wanted</text><text start="1436.135" dur="2.736">to get a trainer that&amp;#39;s
when you took over.</text><text start="1438.871" dur="2.669">- Yeah, so this is 2011, 
I think?</text><text start="1441.54" dur="2.836">- Mhmmm. Maybe &amp;#39;12.</text><text start="1444.376" dur="2.436">- It was right when 
Thank You Economy came out.</text><text start="1446.812" dur="0.834">- Okay &amp;#39;11.</text><text start="1447.646" dur="2.603">- 2011-ish and Gary and I met.</text><text start="1450.249" dur="2.903">he was giving a talk at
the Apple Store in SoHo,</text><text start="1453.152" dur="2.402">I went down in my Jets gear</text><text start="1455.554" dur="2.536">which is not like me blowing
Gary, I&amp;#39;m just a big fuckin&amp;#39;</text><text start="1458.09" dur="4.838">Jets fan to my ever-lasting
dismay and so we met,</text><text start="1462.928" dur="3.771">we chat a little bit, just
rapport building relationships</text><text start="1466.699" dur="3.236">and as most people do
inappropriately,</text><text start="1469.935" dur="2.469">he commented on my physique,
turned out I was trainer,</text><text start="1472.404" dur="2.169">give him my card, 
which he then lost.</text><text start="1474.573" dur="1.135">Couple week later--</text><text start="1475.708" dur="0.834">- I threw it out.</text><text start="1476.542" dur="0.834">- Yeah, fuck this.</text><text start="1477.376" dur="0.834">(audience laughs)</text><text start="1478.21" dur="2.97">&amp;#39;Cause at that point I was
like, 2011 John was like</text><text start="1481.18" dur="1.635">I&amp;#39;m super professional, 
business cards.</text><text start="1482.815" dur="2.769">I should have just 
fuckin&amp;#39; Tweeted at him.</text><text start="1485.584" dur="1.401">And then, he put up on Facebook</text><text start="1486.985" dur="4.572">that he needed a trainer 
and so people did</text><text start="1491.557" dur="1.802">what is inexplicable to me,</text><text start="1493.359" dur="1.334">people who follow Gary,</text><text start="1494.693" dur="1.902">instead of leveraging 
what they do,</text><text start="1496.595" dur="1.468">they all just jumped on
that Facebook thread,</text><text start="1498.063" dur="1.168">pick me, pick me, pick me</text><text start="1499.231" dur="4.004">and the shit that Gary
talks about not doing.</text><text start="1503.235" dur="1.068">And so I was like fuck that</text><text start="1504.303" dur="1.301">and I just posted on my Facebook</text><text start="1505.604" dur="1.869">and sent everyone 
on my page over</text><text start="1507.473" dur="1.601">to blow up his 
thread and so then,</text><text start="1509.074" dur="2.336">I got an email 
maybe 20 minutes later</text><text start="1511.41" dur="3.136">from Phil Torano who was
then Gary&amp;#39;s assistant</text><text start="1514.546" dur="2.169">and that Monday, I was
in the gym with Gary.</text><text start="1516.715" dur="3.137">So the plan, initially, 
was to train</text><text start="1519.852" dur="2.135">four to five days a week, 
for an hour</text><text start="1521.987" dur="2.603">and then Gary made it a
habit of cancelling on me</text><text start="1524.59" dur="1.735">at least three times a week.</text><text start="1526.325" dur="1.601">And I let him off the hook.</text><text start="1527.926" dur="1.435">It was really cool to
be working with Gary.</text><text start="1529.361" dur="0.868">But we do a lot

sits in the venn diagram</text><text start="1605.537" dur="1.101">of being good enough for me</text><text start="1606.638" dur="1.702">to feel comfortable

be good enough,</text><text start="1614.279" dur="1.869">they have to be at a

only have one client.</text><text start="1618.183" dur="2.069">It needs to make sense in
all these different facets.</text><text start="1620.252" dur="1.768">And so, the only guy 
I could think of</text><text start="1622.02" dur="2.436">was a kid who had started
as an intern for me,</text><text start="1624.456" dur="1.135">he became my

trained with him briefly.</text><text start="1630.729" dur="1.201">- That was the worse four months</text><text start="1631.93" dur="1.201">like two sessions.
- Yeah like in four months</text><text start="1633.131" dur="0.968">he had like three sessions.</text><text start="1634.099" dur="2.803">And so, I was like,

about every business.</text><text start="1697.996" dur="2.069">I talk a lot about 
fitness entrepreneurs</text><text start="1700.065" dur="2.669">who are so good 
about their physique</text><text start="1702.734" dur="1.702">and their regime and all that,</text><text start="1704.436" dur="1.502">but then, in their business,</text><text start="1705.938" dur="1.368">their looking for the secret</text><text start="1707.306" dur="3.003">or the 12 courses that
don&amp;#39;t let them do the work.</text><text start="1710.309" dur="1.501">Once I made the 
religious decision</text><text start="1711.81" dur="3.904">to do the work and I had
one interesting unlock</text><text start="1715.714" dur="2.736">that maybe can
help you in some way.</text><text start="1718.45" dur="2.669">I figured out, 
in that really zen place.</text><text start="1721.119" dur="1.602">I was like, fuck, 
it&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="1722.721" dur="1.635">competitive with myself.</text><text start="1724.356" dur="2.636">I don&amp;#39;t give a shit 
if I run four minutes</text><text start="1726.992" dur="2.703">and nine seconds and
yesterday I did 4:11.</text><text start="1729.695" dur="4.07">I&amp;#39;m competitive with everything
in the world but myself.</text><text start="1733.765" dur="1.802">And so I realized 
I needed to be held</text><text start="1735.567" dur="1.969">accountable to another human.</text><text start="1737.536" dur="2.569">I work out every single
day and don&amp;#39;t cheat.</text><text start="1740.105" dur="1.835">I&amp;#39;ve been unbelievable 
&amp;#39;cause I don&amp;#39;t want</text><text start="1741.94" dur="1.769">to let Mike down.</text><text start="1743.709" dur="1.401">And because, 
I know every morning</text><text start="1745.11" dur="1.335">I&amp;#39;m going to go on the scale</text><text start="1746.445" dur="1.601">and Mike&amp;#39;s going to know.</text><text start="1748.046" dur="3.17">I&amp;#39;ve suffocated 
myself and by the way,</text><text start="1752.417" dur="2.937">Mike&amp;#39;s tenure of 
two years all-in,</text><text start="1755.354" dur="1.468">is done July seventh.</text><text start="1756.822" dur="3.336">I have a new guy 
starting for three years.</text><text start="1760.158" dur="4.338">And I&amp;#39;m very comfortable

- Hey, man.</text><text start="1784.016" dur="1.401">- [Man] I&amp;#39;d like to
ask ask about chatbots,</text><text start="1785.417" dur="1.368">do you think that&amp;#39;s gonna
be the next big thing?</text><text start="1786.785" dur="1.602">Should we be 
investing in chatbots?</text><text start="1788.387" dur="1.234">- Like bots in general?</text><text start="1789.621" dur="2.536">- [Man] Or, 
messenger as a platform?</text><text start="1792.157" dur="2.269">- Yeah, I mean, look. 
It&amp;#39;s huge in Asia,</text><text start="1794.426" dur="3.37">there&amp;#39;s enormous 
opportunities for bots</text><text start="1797.796" dur="3.57">to make life more scalable,</text><text start="1801.366" dur="1.201">things of that nature.</text><text start="1802.567" dur="4.105">So yeah, do I think bots in
messaging apps are a pillar?</text><text start="1806.672" dur="3.603">Yeah, I do. And I think it&amp;#39;s
gonna take 3, 4, 5, years,</text><text start="1810.275" dur="3.404">for it to be a real scale,
but it&amp;#39;s talking about</text><text start="1813.679" dur="3.57">search in &amp;#39;01 or email
in &amp;#39;96 or social in &amp;#39;07,</text><text start="1817.249" dur="1.435">I think it&amp;#39;s a real genre.</text><text start="1818.684" dur="2.235">And here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s 
more important:</text><text start="1820.919" dur="2.236">it&amp;#39;s kinda like Google
Glass or other things</text><text start="1823.155" dur="2.202">that have not worked out,</text><text start="1825.357" dur="1.835">whether it works or not</text><text start="1827.192" dur="3.37">AI and automation 
will never stop.</text><text start="1830.562" dur="1.635">We&amp;#39;re gonna become robots.</text><text start="1832.197" dur="4.872">So, whether bots on messenger
become the way you win</text><text start="1837.803" dur="3.069">is far more irrelevant 
than the fact</text><text start="1840.872" dur="3.27">that you get the taste
of what the concept is,</text><text start="1844.142" dur="1.335">so that if in
two to four, seven,</text><text start="1845.477" dur="2.069">nine, 14 years from now</text><text start="1847.546" dur="4.404">it&amp;#39;s VR augmented execution
that breaks through for you.</text><text start="1851.95" dur="2.636">The thing that pisses me
off is how many of you</text><text start="1854.586" dur="1.902">have not used Snapchat &amp;#39;cause</text><text start="1856.488" dur="1.235">you &amp;quot;think it&amp;#39;s a waste of time</text><text start="1857.723" dur="1.868">&amp;quot;in case it&amp;#39;s a fad&amp;quot;</text><text start="1859.591" dur="2.97">and you don&amp;#39;t realize the
tasting the execution</text><text start="1862.561" dur="2.202">sets you up for the next thing.</text><text start="1864.763" dur="4.504">I wasted, I wasted a
fuckload of time on Socialcam</text><text start="1869.267" dur="4.238">because it was a fad
except it taught me 90%</text><text start="1873.505" dur="2.369">of what made me successful
on Vine and Instagram video</text><text start="1875.874" dur="2.669">and Snapchat, and so please,</text><text start="1878.543" dur="3.47">enough of &amp;quot;well what if
this is here tomorrow?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1882.013" dur="2.503">Who gives a fuck?

are massively important</text><text start="1892.924" dur="3.07">for this group, not because
you figured out what bot</text><text start="1895.994" dur="2.87">to make on Slack

humans interact with augmented,</text><text start="1904.102" dur="2.536">and then learn

build their own brand</text><text start="1933.498" dur="1.502">and probably steal 
half your shit.</text><text start="1935" dur="1.535">How do you get around that?</text><text start="1936.535" dur="2.936">- So, first of all, 
I get around it</text><text start="1939.471" dur="2.002">by not being crippled by it.</text><text start="1941.473" dur="3.203">So I&amp;#39;m just not

I&amp;#39;m actually very fond</text><text start="2128.76" dur="2.669">of average players on your team.</text><text start="2131.429" dur="1.435">If you go for scale. 
If you&amp;#39;re gonna build</text><text start="2132.864" dur="2.469">a four person company,
y&amp;#39;all have to be ninjas.</text><text start="2135.333" dur="1.001">I get it.</text><text start="2136.334" dur="3.47">But if you&amp;#39;re building
a 700 person company,</text><text start="2139.804" dur="2.303">you don&amp;#39;t have 700 As.</text><text start="2142.107" dur="2.202">As a matter of fact, if
you really break it down,</text><text start="2144.309" dur="3.036">anybody that works for
someone else isn&amp;#39;t like you.</text><text start="2147.345" dur="2.136">There was no me working for you.</text><text start="2149.481" dur="3.27">So number one, 
it was the acceptance</text><text start="2152.751" dur="2.435">of not being crippled. 
First, hiring</text><text start="2155.186" dur="1.602">ultra-fast -- ugh.</text><text start="2158.089" dur="1.635">The hiring process 
at VaynerMedia is,</text><text start="2159.724" dur="2.736">&amp;quot;Are you alive? You&amp;#39;re hired!&amp;quot;
You know?</text><text start="2162.46" dur="2.57">(crowd laughs)</text><text start="2166.264" dur="1.869">The truth is, it got a
little bit better than that</text><text start="2168.133" dur="1.134">when I got out of the equation.</text><text start="2169.267" dur="2.603">But when I hired 
employee 30 to a buck 50,</text><text start="2171.87" dur="1.968">people barely got 
off the elevator</text><text start="2173.838" dur="4.071">and I was like, 
&amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s your punch card.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2177.909" dur="2.136">A lot of the early 
people knew who I was,</text><text start="2180.045" dur="1.034">and they thought 
it might be hard --</text><text start="2181.079" dur="1.535">I mean they couldn&amp;#39;t believe it.</text><text start="2182.614" dur="1.468">I was like, &amp;quot;You like sports?&amp;quot;</text><text start="2184.082" dur="3.303">&amp;quot;Nah.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re hired!
(crowd laughs)</text><text start="2187.385" dur="3.704">It was just whatever because
I realized we were growing.</text><text start="2191.089" dur="2.903">And here is something very
interesting:</text><text start="2193.992" dur="1.868">one thing that you have to
understand is,</text><text start="2195.86" dur="3.871">you can&amp;#39;t be the judge and
the jury for the market.</text><text start="2199.731" dur="1.868">One of the reasons I grew it so
fast was</text><text start="2201.599" dur="2.703">we were so ahead of the market
with social media marketing</text><text start="2204.302" dur="2.703">and strategy that even if
they were B and C players,</text><text start="2207.005" dur="3.07">I knew they were A players to
the market.</text><text start="2210.075" dur="3.536">So my B and C could walk
into Campbell&amp;#39;s Soup</text><text start="2213.611" dur="2.303">and seem like a super A.</text><text start="2215.914" dur="1.201">So I think one of the things is</text><text start="2217.115" dur="2.402">if you&amp;#39;re great at search,</text><text start="2219.517" dur="2.069">what you need to understand
is who you&amp;#39;re selling to</text><text start="2221.586" dur="2.903">may not be as great as you are.</text><text start="2224.489" dur="1.635">And please, I wanna make
sure I&amp;#39;m being very,</text><text start="2226.124" dur="1.268">this is what&amp;#39;s great about
having time</text><text start="2227.392" dur="1.468">to give these 
detailed answers,</text><text start="2228.86" dur="2.769">I&amp;#39;m not talking about selling
stuff you don&amp;#39;t believe in.</text><text start="2231.629" dur="3.27">You gotta understand 
a lot of people,</text><text start="2234.899" dur="1.702">you know what&amp;#39;s funny?
I had a lot of &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; men</text><text start="2236.601" dur="1.568">and &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; women around me.</text><text start="2238.169" dur="1.602">For somebody&amp;#39;s so hyperbolized,</text><text start="2239.771" dur="1.968">I like people who will
push back against me.</text><text start="2241.739" dur="4.271">I need the context. So a
lot of them pushed very hard</text><text start="2246.01" dur="3.671">in 2010 and &amp;#39;11 of, like,
&amp;quot;Gary, what&amp;#39;s the--&amp;quot;</text><text start="2249.681" dur="1.902">right in my team, like
does this mean anything?</text><text start="2251.583" dur="1.768">Does this help the client?</text><text start="2253.351" dur="2.369">And I educate him, like look,
and this</text><text start="2255.72" dur="1.635">was before there was paid social</text><text start="2257.355" dur="1.702">that could drive the
business results we have now</text><text start="2259.057" dur="2.002">so it was very organic, I go,
&amp;quot;look,</text><text start="2261.059" dur="1.068">&amp;quot;here&amp;#39;s what you 
have to understand.</text><text start="2262.127" dur="4.037">&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re paying us 
$5,000 dollars a month</text><text start="2266.164" dur="2.269">&amp;quot;for the amount of content
and strategy we&amp;#39;re giving them</text><text start="2268.433" dur="4.137">&amp;quot;and just the IP for
60,000 a year is a gift</text><text start="2272.57" dur="1.669">&amp;quot;for these companies.</text><text start="2274.239" dur="3.203">&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re paying 
$5,000 dollars right now</text><text start="2277.442" dur="3.904">&amp;quot;for the catering bill on
their bullshit commercial.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2281.346" dur="2.502">So it&amp;#39;s about contextualizing.</text><text start="2285.984" dur="2.302">One was the culture,</text><text start="2288.286" dur="1.368">keep continuity.</text><text start="2289.654" dur="1.902">The amount of people I have,</text><text start="2291.556" dur="3.737">our voluntary turnover 
rate is 75-100,</text><text start="2295.293" dur="4.004">like it&amp;#39;s unbelievably
better than the market.</text><text start="2299.297" dur="3.036">Two, it was my 
brand leadership as a,</text><text start="2302.333" dur="4.038">I mean, I had a real,
what do you mean I had,</text><text start="2306.371" dur="1.935">I have a real fuckin&amp;#39; racket.</text><text start="2308.306" dur="3.337">I get paid $100,000
dollars to go and speak</text><text start="2311.643" dur="2.669">and then land million dollar
accounts.</text><text start="2314.312" dur="3.437">That&amp;#39;s fucking good, you know?
(crowd laughs)</text><text start="2317.749" dur="1.368">You know what I mean?</text><text start="2319.117" dur="1.401">It was funny, 
I saw you shaking your head</text><text start="2320.518" dur="1.602">to some stuff right now.
I always pay attention</text><text start="2322.12" dur="1.802">to who&amp;#39;s vibing with 
me when I speak,</text><text start="2323.922" dur="1.501">and I use their positive energy</text><text start="2325.423" dur="2.669">to keep my momentum going.</text><text start="2328.092" dur="3.804">This one Toyota talk,
small group this size,</text><text start="2331.896" dur="3.771">it was just one 
guy giving me vibes.</text><text start="2335.667" dur="1.501">Mentally, I&amp;#39;m like 
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna go thank</text><text start="2337.168" dur="1.468">&amp;quot;that guy after this talk.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2338.636" dur="2.469">Guy ends up being the
fucking CMO of Toyota.</text><text start="2341.105" dur="4.171">This was a dealership, like,
northeast steelers, you know?</text><text start="2347.979" dur="2.236">The speaking, my brand.</text><text start="2350.215" dur="3.837">And then finally, and this
will always be tried and true,</text><text start="2354.052" dur="2.502">as charismatic and 
as cool as I am,</text><text start="2356.554" dur="2.336">as much as 
we have continuity,</text><text start="2358.89" dur="3.637">there is no 100 million dollars,
there is no 30 to 650 people</text><text start="2362.527" dur="2.402">three-to-100 million 
revenue in four years</text><text start="2364.929" dur="2.736">without doing good work. So
the biggest growth we had,</text><text start="2367.665" dur="1.368">the biggest,</text><text start="2369.033" dur="3.637">was somebody at 
Pepsi being blown,</text><text start="2372.67" dur="3.938">Lipton, Brisk Ice Tea,

300 days a week.</text><text start="2693.524" dur="1.802">I&amp;#39;ve missed stuff</text><text start="2695.326" dur="2.069">but I&amp;#39;ll never miss it

I&amp;#39;m very fascinated by</text><text start="2700.298" dur="3.937">is a lot of my friends

time with their kids.</text><text start="2706.737" dur="3.404">So like, a lot of my
buddies are absolutely like,</text><text start="2710.141" dur="2.502">will razz me, and then I&amp;#39;ll
razz them back and be like,</text><text start="2712.643" dur="2.569">&amp;quot;Dude, I was over at
your house the other day.</text><text start="2715.212" dur="2.036">&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not with you,

to say another thing.</text><text start="2723.087" dur="2.569">There&amp;#39;s a couple things that
I&amp;#39;m absolutely adamant about.</text><text start="2725.656" dur="3.637">I will never give you, 
I will never judge,</text><text start="2729.293" dur="1.969">forget about give you, 
I think we all like to spew</text><text start="2731.262" dur="1.368">a little advice.</text><text start="2732.63" dur="3.57">I will never judge 
somebody&amp;#39;s relationship</text><text start="2736.2" dur="1.902">or how they parent.</text><text start="2738.102" dur="3.036">I&amp;#39;m the by-product 
of immigrant parents,</text><text start="2741.138" dur="2.77">where I didn&amp;#39;t even see my
dad until I was 15 years old</text><text start="2743.908" dur="2.035">and he&amp;#39;s my best bud.</text><text start="2745.943" dur="2.269">We have the greatest
relationships of all time.</text><text start="2748.212" dur="1.802">So, of course I&amp;#39;m 
effected by that, right?</text><text start="2750.014" dur="2.936">Of course I&amp;#39;m effected by,
&amp;quot;Shit, my dad got away with.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2752.95" dur="2.202">But I&amp;#39;m also 
not taking for granted</text><text start="2755.152" dur="2.903">that my kids are wired
the same way that I was.</text><text start="2758.055" dur="2.636">I think it&amp;#39;s an 
always moving thing.</text><text start="2762.159" dur="3.904">So, I don&amp;#39;t know, man, I don&amp;#39;t
know what I&amp;#39;m going to do.</text><text start="2766.063" dur="2.369">But I really,
I just know my truth</text><text start="2768.432" dur="2.836">which is if I&amp;#39;m not happy,
then everything else breaks,</text><text start="2771.268" dur="2.436">and if it makes me 
unhappy not to hustle,</text><text start="2773.704" dur="2.803">and do my thing, 
that&amp;#39;s a vulnerability.</text><text start="2776.507" dur="1.935">And that&amp;#39;s a real 
truth that people</text><text start="2778.442" dur="1.368">don&amp;#39;t want to say out loud.</text><text start="2779.81" dur="3.604">Which is, I know what the
politically correct thing</text><text start="2783.414" dur="3.17">to say here is, I know what
everybody wants to say,</text><text start="2786.584" dur="3.203">but I&amp;#39;m suffocated not being me.</text><text start="2789.787" dur="2.202">I&amp;#39;m suffocated not being me.</text><text start="2791.989" dur="3.637">And my kids are way
worse off if I&amp;#39;m unhappy</text><text start="2795.626" dur="4.405">than being happy, and so, 
I don&amp;#39;t want to let them down.</text><text start="2801.132" dur="1.568">I&amp;#39;m pretty, I&amp;#39;m already,</text><text start="2802.7" dur="2.803">listen, I&amp;#39;m taking seven
weeks vacation a year</text><text start="2805.503" dur="2.969">and it&amp;#39;s hardcore quality
time in that seven weeks.</text><text start="2808.472" dur="2.436">And then with weekends,
I actually weirdly think</text><text start="2810.908" dur="0.968">I need to work more.</text><text start="2811.876" dur="2.035">I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;Fuck, there&amp;#39;s

of those kind of things</text><text start="2834.465" dur="4.438">that will keep them into

watching it very carefully</text><text start="2944.041" dur="2.002">as I know you know.</text><text start="2946.043" dur="2.403">It takes too much time.</text><text start="2948.446" dur="1.968">We like time more than context.</text><text start="2950.414" dur="2.536">So why voice is incredible is,</text><text start="2952.95" dur="3.07">do you know how many times
you misinterpreted a Tweet</text><text start="2956.02" dur="1.101">or an email?</text><text start="2957.121" dur="1.501">A fuckload.</text><text start="2958.622" dur="1.902">&amp;#39;Cause tone is lost in writing.</text><text start="2960.524" dur="2.736">What Voice does incredibly

I&amp;#39;m going to start with.</text><text start="3071.068" dur="3.37">I&amp;#39;ve been looking at deals
for the last 18 months.</text><text start="3074.438" dur="1.735">I even got into

way the numbers looked.</text><text start="3078.208" dur="3.07">So first of all, 
number one rule is,</text><text start="3081.278" dur="3.704">it had to be big at one
point and it&amp;#39;s not right now.</text><text start="3084.982" dur="1.068">Right?</text><text start="3086.05" dur="3.57">So, Bubblicious Bubble Gum,</text><text start="3089.62" dur="2.369">did $128 million in revenue</text><text start="3093.824" dur="4.171">13 years ago, 17 years ago,

My Little Pony and dadadada.</text><text start="3141.438" dur="2.469">So, it has to be underpriced,</text><text start="3143.907" dur="5.005">had to have a lot of revenue,

very strong 13 to 30</text><text start="3153.217" dur="3.77">because my marketing

is always underpriced.</text><text start="3177.508" dur="1.801">Snapchat and 
Instagram influencers</text><text start="3179.309" dur="1.335">and Snapchat marketing</text><text start="3180.644" dur="3.537">are underpriced, grossly

when a couple of the early</text><text start="3324.488" dur="2.369">people did it, it was novel.</text><text start="3326.857" dur="1.435">It caught our attention.</text><text start="3328.292" dur="3.436">Yes, the younger set does

with continuous stories,</text><text start="3455.485" dur="2.77">I think they&amp;#39;re going to

than anything in the world</text><text start="4889.852" dur="3.336">and so I do think, 
I think that&amp;#39;s the key</text><text start="4893.188" dur="2.536">to the question

I have a two part question,</text><text start="5494.556" dur="1.535">one is, what do you 
fuck up on, often?</text><text start="5496.091" dur="0.834">- Yes.</text><text start="5496.925" dur="2.069">- [Man 10] And when you lose,
how do you not lose the lesson?</text><text start="5498.994" dur="3.269">- How do I not lose the lesson?</text><text start="5502.263" dur="2.503">So I love losing, and
I hate losing, right?</text><text start="5504.766" dur="1.368">They&amp;#39;re like, polar opposites.</text><text start="5506.134" dur="2.102">So the thing I most 
fuck up on, is that</text><text start="5508.236" dur="1.702">I think I can do everything.</text><text start="5509.938" dur="3.737">I have big eyes, you
know? Fat kid cake. Right?</text><text start="5513.675" dur="2.569">Like, I just have big eyes.</text><text start="5516.244" dur="2.369">I just, because 
I work so much,</text><text start="5518.613" dur="2.035">and I work so hard, 
and so intense</text><text start="5520.648" dur="3.437">I always think that 
I can pull it off, so,</text><text start="5524.085" dur="2.936">sometimes I&amp;#39;m just trying to
do 78 things, and you can&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="5527.021" dur="2.57">That&amp;#39;s my common mistake,
I&amp;#39;ll always do that.</text><text start="5529.591" dur="2.402">Its, because 
somewhere deep down,</text><text start="5531.993" dur="1.502">I still think it&amp;#39;s working out,</text><text start="5533.495" dur="1.568">&amp;#39;cause I think 
it&amp;#39;s a net-net game,</text><text start="5535.063" dur="2.936">but it is where I fall short,</text><text start="5537.999" dur="2.636">on more than a micro level,
probably a,</text><text start="5540.635" dur="4.071">three fourths micro,
all the way up to macro.</text><text start="5544.706" dur="1.835">For me, I never, 
I mean, I don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="5546.541" dur="1.668">if it&amp;#39;s the same 
reason that I remember</text><text start="5548.209" dur="1.168">everything that&amp;#39;s ever happened,</text><text start="5549.377" dur="1.335">like I remember everything.</text><text start="5550.712" dur="2.736">Like, I remember Flowtown.</text><text start="5553.448" dur="2.803">Like, like, like you know?
Like, I remember everything.</text><text start="5556.251" dur="1.368">Like just, fuckin&amp;#39; everything.</text><text start="5557.619" dur="2.969">And so, I,</text><text start="5560.588" dur="2.369">because of that, I guess?</text><text start="5562.957" dur="1.535">I don&amp;#39;t lose the lessons?</text><text start="5564.492" dur="2.87">Because I can never, ever,</text><text start="5567.362" dur="2.569">understand why 
someone would knowingly</text><text start="5569.931" dur="2.336">make the same mistake twice.</text><text start="5573.601" dur="1.735">So. Yep.</text><text start="5577.505" dur="1.702">- [Man 7] You still 
good with time?</text><text start="5579.207" dur="2.536">Yeah, I&amp;#39;m fighting it. 
I pushed the call for a second.</text><text start="5581.743" dur="1.034">- [Woman] Thank you for this.</text><text start="5582.777" dur="1.402">- You&amp;#39;re welcome.</text><text start="5584.179" dur="0.834">- [Woman] I wanted 
to ask you a question,</text><text start="5585.013" dur="1.635">in fact, you were talking
about self-awareness.</text><text start="5586.648" dur="0.834">- Yes.</text><text start="5587.482" dur="1.935">- [Woman] And, where 
do you get most of</text><text start="5589.417" dur="1.435">your self-awareness 
is this one of the</text><text start="5590.852" dur="1.802">things you feel 
like you&amp;#39;ve had--</text><text start="5592.654" dur="1.868">- Yes
- Or is it life lessons,</text><text start="5594.522" dur="3.003">is it really the shit,
like, the hard moments?</text><text start="5597.525" dur="2.503">Can you give some 
examples of where</text><text start="5600.028" dur="1.168">you&amp;#39;ve had some--</text><text start="5601.196" dur="1.868">- I think it started--
- [Woman] Big awakenings?</text><text start="5603.064" dur="0.868">I guess, right?
- Yeah.</text><text start="5603.932" dur="1.034">Yeah, you know what?</text><text start="5604.966" dur="3.871">So, I realized somewhere 
around sophomore</text><text start="5608.837" dur="1.801">year of high school,</text><text start="5610.638" dur="0.835">that</text><text start="5613.007" dur="3.604">suddenly way more 
people than I wanted</text><text start="5616.611" dur="1.401">found me annoying.</text><text start="5618.012" dur="1.402">(laughter)</text><text start="5619.414" dur="3.136">That was probably the
first time I was like,</text><text start="5622.55" dur="1.669">maybe I was losing that like,</text><text start="5624.219" dur="2.102">I remember back, 
I remember early high school</text><text start="5626.321" dur="2.035">being like, wait a minute!</text><text start="5628.356" dur="1.435">They&amp;#39;re not highly entertained</text><text start="5629.791" dur="1.334">and finding this interesting?</text><text start="5631.125" dur="1.635">(laughter)</text><text start="5632.76" dur="2.903">So, I do remember,</text><text start="5635.663" dur="3.003">I think it&amp;#39;s DNA. 
I don&amp;#39;t know where I get it,</text><text start="5638.666" dur="1.969">I don&amp;#39;t, but I, 
when you said that,</text><text start="5640.635" dur="4.504">like, I do remember, 
from 12 to 18,</text><text start="5645.707" dur="3.436">I found my way, 
how to make this,</text><text start="5649.143" dur="3.27">more palpable, and 
I thought really owned it,</text><text start="5652.413" dur="3.237">and got great at it, until 
I became more of a public
figure,</text><text start="5655.65" dur="1.468">and every time 
I fuckin&amp;#39; post a piece</text><text start="5657.118" dur="2.002">of content on 
Facebook it goes viral,</text><text start="5659.12" dur="1.902">4,000 people 
say I&amp;#39;m a dick face.</text><text start="5661.022" dur="1.502">(laughter)</text><text start="5662.524" dur="3.67">So, you know, 
I think that I try to</text><text start="5666.194" dur="2.97">deploy self-awareness 
as much as possible,</text><text start="5669.164" dur="3.837">and now, I&amp;#39;m self-aware 
that 20% of people</text><text start="5673.001" dur="1.902">on first impact
(laughter)</text><text start="5674.903" dur="1.835">are not gonna like it.</text><text start="5677.672" dur="2.87">And so, I do think it came
from the lessons of life.</text><text start="5680.542" dur="3.003">Like, I think one of the
things that one has to do,</text><text start="5683.545" dur="3.169">is accept themselves, right?</text><text start="5686.714" dur="2.136">And I think once I&amp;#39;m, 
once I did that,</text><text start="5688.85" dur="2.536">then it didn&amp;#39;t hurt 
so much to have 20%,</text><text start="5691.386" dur="1.868">two out of 10 
people not like it.</text><text start="5693.254" dur="2.636">Because the cool thing 
with me is I also</text><text start="5695.89" dur="3.103">have three out of 10 people
that like it so much.</text><text start="5698.993" dur="1.402">And think it&amp;#39;s the coolest
thing they&amp;#39;ve ever seen,</text><text start="5700.395" dur="2.202">and you just play it out, 
and then for me,</text><text start="5702.597" dur="1.401">because I know I&amp;#39;m grounded in</text><text start="5703.998" dur="2.236">very good truths, 
and principles?</text><text start="5706.234" dur="2.436">I get a second at-bat 
at it which is,</text><text start="5708.67" dur="2.869">it&amp;#39;s so rewarding for 
people that thought</text><text start="5711.539" dur="3.704">you were a douchebag, to
turn, and become an advocate.</text><text start="5715.243" dur="1.968">I would tell you, probably the
50 biggest</text><text start="5717.211" dur="1.869">advocates I have on social?</text><text start="5719.08" dur="1.268">Initially hated me.</text><text start="5721.883" dur="1.568">- [Woman] Okay. So was
there, like, you know,</text><text start="5723.451" dur="1.568">a lot of people are in fear--

their own personality.</text><text start="5733.161" dur="1.401">- No, that&amp;#39;s a really
good point, that&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="5734.562" dur="0.901">- [Woman] Okay.

this is interesting to me,</text><text start="5753.581" dur="1.835">this is where, 
this is where hard wiring</text><text start="5755.416" dur="2.203">is something 
I believe in tremendously.</text><text start="5757.619" dur="2.335">It took me, again, when
this started all happening,</text><text start="5759.954" dur="1.635">my 20&amp;#39;s and 30&amp;#39;s 
and 40 and then I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="5761.589" dur="2.87">started realizing this,

old people as a kid.</text><text start="5767.562" dur="2.402">Like, one of, I don&amp;#39;t know
if any of you did this,</text><text start="5769.964" dur="2.77">and, then maybe we have
some connections that way.</text><text start="5772.734" dur="3.036">I was weird as shit,

played outside, right?</text><text start="5780.208" dur="1.902">And so, when we 
were outside playing,</text><text start="5782.11" dur="2.802">grandparents would 
visit once in a while,</text><text start="5784.912" dur="1.535">and maybe &amp;#39;cause I didn&amp;#39;t have,</text><text start="5786.447" dur="1.468">my, both my grandparents,

that&amp;#39;s why, but now</text><text start="5801.796" dur="3.17">I just realize,

a one-to-one level,</text><text start="5985.546" dur="3.804">and I would never, 
ever think about</text><text start="5989.35" dur="2.336">hurting somebody&amp;#39;s feelings,</text><text start="5991.686" dur="1.268">for, like, why?</text><text start="5992.954" dur="0.834">- [Woman 2] Yeah.</text><text start="5993.788" dur="0.834">- You know, so--</text><text start="5994.622" dur="0.834">- [Woman 2] I&amp;#39;m with you.</text><text start="5995.456" dur="1.301">- You know? It&amp;#39;s just when so--</text><text start="5996.757" dur="1.669">I&amp;#39;m more visceral 
when somebody else</text><text start="5998.426" dur="1.301">is doing something to someone.</text><text start="5999.727" dur="1.802">I&amp;#39;m more of like, 
he&amp;#39;s being mean to him,</text><text start="6001.529" dur="1.768">and I&amp;#39;ll, that&amp;#39;s when
I&amp;#39;ll jump in, you know?</text><text start="6003.297" dur="2.503">- [Woman 2] Yes. And I
don&amp;#39;t mean just being mean.</text><text start="6005.8" dur="1.034">- I get it.
- [Woman 2] Although,</text><text start="6006.834" dur="2.036">I have no problem 
with confrontation, whatsoever.</text><text start="6008.87" dur="1.801">(laughter)
I&amp;#39;m a lawyer, so it kinda,</text><text start="6010.671" dur="0.834">and a New Yorker.</text><text start="6011.505" dur="1.268">- By the way, 
you know what, I apologize,</text><text start="6012.773" dur="2.77">my, I would actually argue,
my biggest weakness is,</text><text start="6015.543" dur="3.804">ever, was my lack, 
my visceral reaction</text><text start="6019.347" dur="3.336">to confrontation which
made me very bad at firing,</text><text start="6022.683" dur="3.737">for about 10 to 12 years,
because I was terrible at it.</text><text start="6026.42" dur="1.936">Like, I was terrible at it.</text><text start="6028.356" dur="1.835">I was so full of shit, like,</text><text start="6030.191" dur="2.269">I would never give 
any critical feedback,</text><text start="6032.46" dur="2.102">and then you just 
walk in and be fired,</text><text start="6034.562" dur="2.602">because I&amp;#39;ve got pent up,
enough courage to finally do it,</text><text start="6037.164" dur="1.268">I was terrible at it.</text><text start="6038.432" dur="2.336">And it, and I was 
really bad at it.</text><text start="6040.768" dur="1.702">And it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m
very embarrassed about.</text><text start="6042.47" dur="1.802">And the worst 
version of it, is it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6044.272" dur="1.735">how I broke up 
with girls, and I hate</text><text start="6046.007" dur="1.568">to say it out loud,
(laughter)</text><text start="6047.575" dur="1.468">because I wanna be 
really, like it was,</text><text start="6049.043" dur="2.536">it&amp;#39;s the single thing
I&amp;#39;m most embarrassed of,</text><text start="6051.579" dur="3.036">of the way I broke up
with girls that I dated,</text><text start="6054.615" dur="3.671">because I wasn&amp;#39;t a man enough
to break up to their face.</text><text start="6058.286" dur="1.067">That felt good.</text><text start="6059.353" dur="1.602">(laughter)</text><text start="6060.955" dur="1.868">Good to get the, good
to get the poison out.</text><text start="6062.823" dur="2.269">(laughter and applause)</text><text start="6065.092" dur="0.835">All right, go ahead.</text><text start="6065.927" dur="0.967">- [Woman 2] We forgive you.</text><text start="6066.894" dur="1.969">- Thank you. (laughs)</text><text start="6068.863" dur="1.868">- [Woman 2] So, 
my question really is,</text><text start="6070.731" dur="2.67">like, what&amp;#39;s the ROI 
on not giving a fuck</text><text start="6073.401" dur="1.701">and being 
apologetically yourself.</text><text start="6075.102" dur="2.002">&amp;#39;Cause that&amp;#39;s--
- Speed.</text><text start="6078.439" dur="3.27">Speed. The thing that you, 
when you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="6081.709" dur="3.203">spending any time worrying,</text><text start="6084.912" dur="3.303">you&amp;#39;re spending 
time on executing.</text><text start="6088.215" dur="2.403">Speed.</text><text start="6090.618" dur="2.135">And I like the way a lot
of you reacted to that,</text><text start="6092.753" dur="2.369">because that&amp;#39;s a weird
answer to that question.</text><text start="6095.122" dur="2.503">But I can see that 
a lot of you caught it,</text><text start="6097.625" dur="2.302">and some of you 
understand it and do it.</text><text start="6099.927" dur="4.471">Speed is the game in what
we all do for a living.</text><text start="6104.398" dur="2.67">And if you&amp;#39;re not worried</text><text start="6107.068" dur="2.035">about dwelling</text><text start="6109.103" dur="3.437">on what people think,
you&amp;#39;re in execution mode.</text><text start="6112.54" dur="1.668">And I do everything 
in my possession,</text><text start="6114.208" dur="1.869">everything in my power, 
excuse me,</text><text start="6116.077" dur="3.536">to put myself in full
execution mode at all times.</text><text start="6119.613" dur="1.268">- [Woman 2] Awesome. Thank you.</text><text start="6120.881" dur="2.369">- You got it. All right, now 
I have to go. I love you guys!</text><text start="6123.25" dur="3.337">(cheering and applause)</text><text start="6136.43" dur="3.504">I had a lotta fun, a
lot of fun. Thank you.</text></transcript>
