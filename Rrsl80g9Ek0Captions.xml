<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="10.877" dur="1.134">Good morning.</text><text start="12.011" dur="2.336">Thank you so much for being here
and for taking time out of your</text><text start="14.347" dur="4.004">day to come and see me, and
hopefully what I&amp;#39;m going to say</text><text start="18.351" dur="3.771">will help you in some manner.</text><text start="22.122" dur="1.134">I&amp;#39;m Sally Flaherty.</text><text start="23.256" dur="2.269">You have to have that little
&amp;quot;lilt&amp;quot; in it, because it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="25.525" dur="3.237">grand Irish name.</text><text start="28.762" dur="1.868">And I work for the
Department of Education.</text><text start="30.63" dur="4.138">And, yes, I work for
the Department of Ed. Okay?</text><text start="34.768" dur="4.27">Sometimes it&amp;#39;s not a ride for
the squeamish, but it is such a</text><text start="39.038" dur="1.302">great ride.</text><text start="40.34" dur="5.005">It is good to be able to help
students, and I know you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="45.345" dur="3.336">think about that very often,
that people in PDE are here to</text><text start="48.681" dur="3.604">help students, but I work in the
curriculum department, and I can</text><text start="52.285" dur="3.337">talk for the curriculum
department, and that is what we</text><text start="55.622" dur="1.468">do every day.</text><text start="57.09" dur="5.972">We are here to help you, the
professionals in the field, do</text><text start="63.062" dur="4.872">your jobs to
help students succeed.</text><text start="67.934" dur="3.37">They hired me as the Social
Studies advisor, all right?</text><text start="71.304" dur="5.739">Because Social Studies is a
second session for me, because</text><text start="77.043" dur="3.537">when I graduated from high
school, you know, back with John</text><text start="80.58" dur="4.104">Dewey, they told me that I
was not allowed to be a Social</text><text start="84.684" dur="2.636">Studies teacher
because I couldn&amp;#39;t coach.</text><text start="90.156" dur="2.303">And I believed them.</text><text start="92.459" dur="1.935">So, I said, &amp;quot;Well, okay.&amp;quot;</text><text start="94.394" dur="3.537">So, my sister was a speech
pathologist, and I figured if</text><text start="97.931" dur="2.569">she could do it,
I could do it. Right?</text><text start="100.5" dur="2.869">So, I&amp;#39;m a certified speech and
language pathologist, and still</text><text start="103.369" dur="3.003">have kept up with my
certifications on that.</text><text start="106.372" dur="5.873">But I concentrated on
language for learning.</text><text start="112.245" dur="3.704">How does a child
need language to learn?</text><text start="115.949" dur="4.871">Which got me into learning,
because, as educators, we&amp;#39;re in</text><text start="120.82" dur="5.005">the business of learning, and we
had to do a lot of interest in</text><text start="128.595" dur="1.534">how a child learns.</text><text start="130.129" dur="3.804">Because, just because I teach a
dog to whistle doesn&amp;#39;t mean he</text><text start="133.933" dur="3.337">can whistle, because he
can&amp;#39;t have the capacity.</text><text start="137.27" dur="0.934">I&amp;#39;ve tried.</text><text start="138.204" dur="3.17">It just doesn&amp;#39;t work, but
maybe it was because it was</text><text start="141.374" dur="0.701">a Chihuahua.</text><text start="142.075" dur="2.169">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="144.244" dur="4.971">So, but I went back to school,
because apparently going to</text><text start="149.215" dur="1.702">school is what I do best.</text><text start="150.917" dur="4.071">And, I got my Social Studies
degree, and I am now the content</text><text start="154.988" dur="1.968">advisor for Social Studies.</text><text start="156.956" dur="5.072">So, in the meantime, I got a
curriculum degree, and I got my</text><text start="162.028" dur="4.371">administration degree, and
I was working with behavior.</text><text start="166.399" dur="2.736">I&amp;#39;m this close
to getting my BCBA.</text><text start="169.135" dur="3.137">It&amp;#39;s been a convoluted road.</text><text start="172.272" dur="2.369">We always called it
&amp;quot;resume building.&amp;quot;</text><text start="174.641" dur="5.839">I worked at a small IU in the
west, and anybody here, as you</text><text start="180.48" dur="4.204">know, and as you are all doing
right now, you wear many hats.</text><text start="184.684" dur="1.168">Don&amp;#39;t you?</text><text start="185.852" dur="3.437">And, how many times during the
day do you have to switch, and</text><text start="189.289" dur="1.001">you say, &amp;quot;Okay.</text><text start="190.29" dur="2.535">Am I the PIMS coordinator
now, or am I the data person?&amp;quot;</text><text start="192.825" dur="1.268">You get it.</text><text start="194.093" dur="1.202">Don&amp;#39;t be worried about that.</text><text start="195.295" dur="3.503">That&amp;#39;s called
resume building. Okay?</text><text start="198.798" dur="2.936">And you will have a resume when
you&amp;#39;re done as long as your arm,</text><text start="201.734" dur="2.603">and you will be qualified to do
so many things, because you have</text><text start="204.337" dur="2.002">actual experience.</text><text start="207.974" dur="4.705">So, that actual experience in
resume building got me into</text><text start="212.679" dur="5.005">being asked to do the Educator
Dashboard Early Warning System</text><text start="217.684" dur="3.069">Intervention Resource Catalog.</text><text start="220.753" dur="3.003">We always have
long names at PDE.</text><text start="223.756" dur="2.603">So, that&amp;#39;s what I also do.</text><text start="226.359" dur="2.402">I&amp;#39;m not only just the
Social Studies advisor.</text><text start="228.761" dur="4.672">I&amp;#39;m also the program manager
for the Early Warning System</text><text start="233.433" dur="2.669">Intervention Catalog,
otherwise known as</text><text start="236.102" dur="2.102">the Dashboard.</text><text start="238.204" dur="4.471">Which brings us to data, which
brings us to the implementation</text><text start="242.675" dur="4.538">phase of what I&amp;#39;ve seen when I&amp;#39;m
out in the districts, because I</text><text start="247.213" dur="2.503">actually do go to districts.</text><text start="249.716" dur="3.637">And I have been to some of your
districts, and we will come and</text><text start="253.353" dur="3.303">visit you if we are invited.</text><text start="256.656" dur="0.934">We are not police.</text><text start="257.59" dur="2.102">They have not given me a badge.</text><text start="259.692" dur="0.668">I want a badge.</text><text start="260.36" dur="1.968">There are some
days I want a badge.</text><text start="262.328" dur="5.105">They won&amp;#39;t give me a badge,
but we are here to help you.</text><text start="267.433" dur="3.804">If you invite us to come, we
will be there to help you.</text><text start="271.237" dur="3.036">And we are the ones who
do the research for you.</text><text start="274.273" dur="2.303">You don&amp;#39;t have
time to do research.</text><text start="276.576" dur="2.602">So, if you say to me, &amp;quot;What
do I need to do for this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="279.178" dur="2.236">I&amp;#39;ll say, &amp;quot;Well, this is what
the research says,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="281.414" dur="2.436">get back to you after
I do some research.&amp;quot;</text><text start="283.85" dur="0.667">Use me.</text><text start="284.517" dur="1.935">It&amp;#39;s good.</text><text start="286.452" dur="2.236">That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve done here.</text><text start="288.688" dur="3.136">In the implementation phase for
using data, the one thing I have</text><text start="291.824" dur="5.005">found that is an area of
difficulty for leaders is how do</text><text start="300.667" dur="6.606">you put data center stage
in a school culture that is not</text><text start="307.273" dur="2.403">about data?</text><text start="309.676" dur="3.77">The rest of our lives are
filled with real-time data.</text><text start="313.446" dur="5.038">I get into my car, and I turn
on the ignition, and it gives me</text><text start="318.484" dur="5.172">real-time information
about my oil life, my gas.</text><text start="323.656" dur="4.738">Even when I&amp;#39;m driving, it tells
me if I&amp;#39;m driving efficiently</text><text start="328.394" dur="3.17">for fuel economy. Okay?</text><text start="331.564" dur="1.135">That&amp;#39;s real-time data.</text><text start="332.699" dur="5.972">I wear an Apple watch, so I
have real-time data on if I am,</text><text start="338.671" dur="4.038">indeed, having enough active
calories during the day, so I</text><text start="342.709" dur="4.471">can stay fit and get
out of the decade of death.</text><text start="347.18" dur="2.369">Which, when we were 30, that was
funny, but now that I&amp;#39;m in the</text><text start="349.549" dur="4.905">decade, it&amp;#39;s not so much.</text><text start="354.454" dur="1.735">But I use data.</text><text start="356.189" dur="4.771">I thought I was active before,
but once I got this, it&amp;#39;s like,</text><text start="360.96" dur="2.069">I&amp;#39;m like a couch potato.</text><text start="363.029" dur="3.17">And I find myself at night,
it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;I only have 100 more</text><text start="366.199" dur="2.636">steps to reach my goal and get
my badge,&amp;quot; and I get up and I</text><text start="368.835" dur="1.234">walk around my apartment.</text><text start="370.369" dur="1.936">I mean, it&amp;#39;s about
getting the badge. Right?</text><text start="372.972" dur="2.069">But it&amp;#39;s real-time data.</text><text start="375.041" dur="2.402">You live by real-time data.</text><text start="377.443" dur="2.336">We are healthier now as
a nation, because we have</text><text start="379.779" dur="1.001">real-time data.</text><text start="382.915" dur="5.973">Is our educational system
healthy, and how do we know?</text><text start="388.888" dur="2.402">We have to look at the data, but
there&amp;#39;s so much data out there.</text><text start="391.29" dur="4.138">You guys are collecting data
all the time, all the time.</text><text start="395.428" dur="1.501">What do we do with it?</text><text start="396.929" dur="5.84">Do you get data off your
[inaudible] to help students, or</text><text start="402.769" dur="3.536">is it more of a report at the
end of the year of, &amp;quot;You know,</text><text start="406.305" dur="4.638">we didn&amp;#39;t do so well in
February, and it&amp;#39;s June.&amp;quot;</text><text start="410.943" dur="4.772">Those are quarterly reports, you
know, how we do as a nation in</text><text start="415.715" dur="3.837">our economic downturn for
the first quarter, etcetera.</text><text start="419.552" dur="1.768">Real-time data.</text><text start="421.32" dur="5.773">It&amp;#39;s a new concept for
education, because our educators</text><text start="427.093" dur="1.501">love students.</text><text start="428.594" dur="3.17">That&amp;#39;s why they
went into education.</text><text start="431.764" dur="3.67">They did not go into education
for June, July, and August, and</text><text start="435.434" dur="3.371">they did not go in for the pay.</text><text start="438.805" dur="3.903">Maybe for the retirement
benefits, but, you know. No.</text><text start="442.708" dur="2.436">Why did they become educators?</text><text start="445.144" dur="1.502">Let&amp;#39;s think about it.</text><text start="446.646" dur="5.005">So, let&amp;#39;s give them the tools
they need to fulfill what they</text><text start="453.753" dur="5.272">want to do, and help
them do their jobs easier.</text><text start="459.025" dur="3.036">Because loving and being
concerned about the students is</text><text start="462.061" dur="1.969">one thing.</text><text start="464.03" dur="6.106">Having action to put that love
and concern into play, to help a</text><text start="470.136" dur="1.034">child, is another.</text><text start="471.17" dur="4.972">So, as I&amp;#39;m out there in
districts, it is the leader, and</text><text start="481.247" dur="3.537">the leader has to remember this.</text><text start="484.784" dur="2.235">I love Abigail Adams.</text><text start="487.019" dur="3.137">Dated John for a while,
until she found out.</text><text start="490.156" dur="4.871">I mean, I spent hours with him
on TV, and then I read the book.</text><text start="495.027" dur="3.237">And when you spend that many
hours in a book getting to know</text><text start="498.264" dur="2.369">a person, it&amp;#39;s like
you&amp;#39;ve dated them. Right?</text><text start="500.633" dur="5.005">So, Abigail said that learning
must be sought with ardor and</text><text start="508.541" dur="3.704">attended to with diligence.</text><text start="512.245" dur="2.936">Practice makes permanent.</text><text start="519.118" dur="1.401">We have to remember this.</text><text start="520.519" dur="6.64">I have this on my cubicle wall
because it is about diligence</text><text start="527.159" dur="4.705">and ardor, and
happily pursuing a topic.</text><text start="534.734" dur="2.769">You&amp;#39;re in this room
because you are a leader.</text><text start="537.503" dur="2.302">You have been chosen to
represent your district at</text><text start="539.805" dur="2.036">this conference.</text><text start="541.841" dur="2.402">It was not just,
&amp;quot;Well, somebody&amp;#39;s got to go.</text><text start="544.243" dur="2.336">Let&amp;#39;s flip a coin,&amp;quot;
unless that was yours.</text><text start="546.579" dur="2.035">Was that your reason to come?</text><text start="548.614" dur="1.969">You lost the toss?</text><text start="550.583" dur="0.767">All right.</text><text start="551.35" dur="2.169">You&amp;#39;re the leaders,
for whatever reason.</text><text start="553.519" dur="5.606">Whether in title or whether in
character, you are the leader.</text><text start="559.125" dur="4.004">And, as the leader, and if you
are going to be in charge of</text><text start="563.129" dur="5.705">moving data and getting your
educators to use data, these are</text><text start="568.834" dur="2.436">the steps you must do.</text><text start="571.27" dur="6.306">Now, this is going to be basic,
very, very basic, to get</text><text start="577.576" dur="2.803">you started.</text><text start="580.379" dur="4.071">People don&amp;#39;t think like you,
believe it or not, because if</text><text start="584.45" dur="1.735">they thought like you,
then your job would be</text><text start="586.185" dur="1.635">really easy. Right?</text><text start="587.82" dur="4.738">You wouldn&amp;#39;t have to correct the
accuracy of the data that you</text><text start="592.558" dur="2.77">put in. Right?</text><text start="595.328" dur="2.669">That&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re
in that position, or</text><text start="597.997" dur="0.968">your administrators.</text><text start="598.965" dur="1.601">We have any administrators here?</text><text start="600.566" dur="1.969">Yes. Okay?</text><text start="602.535" dur="3.503">If they all thought like you,
your job would be really easy.</text><text start="606.038" dur="0.668">Wouldn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="606.706" dur="1.601">All right.</text><text start="608.307" dur="5.906">So, this presentation is about
using the research that has been</text><text start="614.213" dur="3.904">done before, that
says the wheel is round.</text><text start="618.117" dur="3.003">You don&amp;#39;t have to reinvent it.</text><text start="621.12" dur="3.704">Let&amp;#39;s look at what you need to
do as a leader to start moving</text><text start="624.824" dur="3.403">data center
stage in your school.</text><text start="630.796" dur="5.139">All of this is for you, the
leader, and I can get you a</text><text start="635.935" dur="3.603">badge that says, &amp;quot;The leader,&amp;quot;
if you want, or make yourself</text><text start="639.538" dur="3.37">one, a Post-It note that says,
&amp;quot;The leader,&amp;quot; because that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="642.908" dur="2.47">exactly what you are.</text><text start="645.378" dur="2.936">Start small.</text><text start="648.314" dur="5.105">I want to change the world,
but, when you look at it, and I</text><text start="653.419" dur="6.173">change the world of one child,
I&amp;#39;ve changed their world.</text><text start="659.592" dur="2.002">Think small.</text><text start="664.663" dur="6.54">Begin with core issues that have
validity, that have impact, that</text><text start="671.203" dur="3.871">have a sense of,
I don&amp;#39;t want to say urgency.</text><text start="675.074" dur="6.673">This is urgency,
but not an emergency.</text><text start="681.747" dur="1.635">Start small.</text><text start="683.382" dur="2.336">Begin with a core issue.</text><text start="685.718" dur="5.272">And this is a piece -
provide a positive climate.</text><text start="693.592" dur="5.272">Educators are out there who
think that data is used as</text><text start="698.864" dur="2.536">a gotcha.</text><text start="701.4" dur="3.504">They think that, because of
student performance, you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="704.904" dur="2.102">going to come in and tell
me I&amp;#39;m not doing my job.</text><text start="707.006" dur="4.971">If that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re using data,
stop, because that&amp;#39;s not the use</text><text start="714.58" dur="1.935">of data.</text><text start="716.515" dur="6.941">The use of data is to help
students succeed, not if the</text><text start="723.456" dur="2.736">teacher is doing
their job. Okay?</text><text start="726.192" dur="4.971">The data tells how a student is
doing, and how we as adults can</text><text start="733.399" dur="6.573">change our work, to change our
actions, to help the child.</text><text start="739.972" dur="5.005">Okay? So, always
provide a positive climate.</text><text start="749.982" dur="1.902">Disney, happiest place on Earth.</text><text start="751.884" dur="1.902">Right? Have you been there? Yes.</text><text start="753.786" dur="4.504">It&amp;#39;s about happy for the first
day, and then it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;I</text><text start="758.29" dur="2.169">can&amp;#39;t believe all
these people are here.&amp;quot;</text><text start="760.459" dur="1.669">So, happiest place on Earth.</text><text start="762.128" dur="3.97">Do you know what the ratio
is of positives to negatives?</text><text start="766.098" dur="2.903">70 to 1.</text><text start="769.001" dur="1.301">70 to 1.</text><text start="770.302" dur="3.971">For every negative experience,
you have to have 70 positives,</text><text start="774.273" dur="2.002">because that&amp;#39;s
the tipping point.</text><text start="778.244" dur="2.836">You forget about the negative,
because you have all of these</text><text start="781.08" dur="4.504">positives. 70.</text><text start="785.584" dur="5.673">Now, in your school climate,
are you providing 70 positive</text><text start="791.257" dur="5.572">moments to the
one negative? Yes.</text><text start="796.829" dur="5.105">It&amp;#39;s not easy, but that&amp;#39;s what
it takes to change that climate,</text><text start="801.934" dur="2.202">to be positive.</text><text start="804.136" dur="4.004">You have to change your attitude
and your wording to look at a</text><text start="808.14" dur="1.835">positive side of it.</text><text start="809.975" dur="5.306">So, when we had a child that
screamed, and that&amp;#39;s what he did</text><text start="815.281" dur="4.104">most of the day,

positives, and you do that as</text><text start="828.994" dur="1.602">an exercise.</text><text start="830.596" dur="4.605">What&amp;#39;s the
positive of this? Right?</text><text start="835.201" dur="5.905">You are now the leader and
the teacher for your staff.</text><text start="841.106" dur="2.236">Your staff are your students.</text><text start="846.245" dur="4.137">Provide for
them many opportunities,</text><text start="852.718" dur="2.436">learning opportunities.</text><text start="855.154" dur="1.735">Help it be formative.</text><text start="858.991" dur="2.869">If you have to say, &amp;quot;How

there and you say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve told</text><text start="873.772" dur="2.203">them, and I&amp;#39;ve told
them, and I&amp;#39;ve told them.</text><text start="875.975" dur="2.068">I&amp;#39;ve told them

we&amp;#39;re going to examine.</text><text start="950.816" dur="2.903">Basically, it&amp;#39;s like, what
do you want to examine?</text><text start="953.719" dur="3.003">You have got to be specific.</text><text start="956.722" dur="3.937">You have got to spend time
sorting it through and seeing</text><text start="960.659" dur="1.368">what you want.</text><text start="962.027" dur="4.505">Now, this is all done...you&amp;#39;re
doing this in your car, in your</text><text start="966.532" dur="4.571">racquetball session, in your
job, in your office, if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="971.103" dur="3.337">in the cafeteria pretending
that you&amp;#39;re watching people.</text><text start="974.44" dur="4.037">Okay. What do you
want to examine?</text><text start="978.477" dur="4.304">Are you collecting
that data already?</text><text start="982.781" dur="3.637">So, you better talk to your
data people to know what you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="986.418" dur="2.87">collecting. All right?</text><text start="990.122" dur="3.303">I had one school that had no
idea how many assessments they</text><text start="993.425" dur="2.536">gave in the school.</text><text start="995.961" dur="2.336">So, we had to do an inventory.</text><text start="998.297" dur="2.269">They couldn&amp;#39;t believe how many
assessments were going on in</text><text start="1000.566" dur="2.302">their school on a daily basis.</text><text start="1002.868" dur="3.904">So they really did begin to
know then about too much testing</text><text start="1006.772" dur="2.636">time. Okay?</text><text start="1009.408" dur="1.702">What are you collecting?</text><text start="1011.11" dur="7.707">What is the process to
provide you that data?</text><text start="1018.817" dur="6.44">I may want to know what my
target heart rate is and how</text><text start="1025.524" dur="4.037">many minutes I am in the zone,
but can I get that information?</text><text start="1032.064" dur="1.835">How easy is it to get?</text><text start="1033.899" dur="2.402">How difficult is it to get?</text><text start="1036.301" dur="3.304">And do you already collect it?</text><text start="1039.605" dur="1.701">Who will examine that data?</text><text start="1041.306" dur="3.971">So, once you get it, and you get
your focus, who do you want to</text><text start="1045.277" dur="2.536">look at it?</text><text start="1047.813" dur="3.737">But, above all, are
they data literate?</text><text start="1053.752" dur="5.305">We can assume they know, but I&amp;#39;m
telling you, elementary school,</text><text start="1059.057" dur="4.605">elementary school teachers,
and you look at the graduate</text><text start="1063.662" dur="5.072">programs for getting a degree in
elementary education, do any of</text><text start="1068.734" dur="3.837">them require higher level
math for graduation to get a</text><text start="1072.571" dur="2.169">Master&amp;#39;s degree?</text><text start="1074.74" dur="6.139">So, the last time an elementary
teacher had any kind of math</text><text start="1080.879" dur="7.241">course was when?</text><text start="1088.12" dur="1.168">Audience: [Inaudible]</text><text start="1089.288" dur="2.569">Yes. You have to think.</text><text start="1091.857" dur="3.57">Was it their freshman
year in college? Maybe.</text><text start="1095.427" dur="4.838">But some can get through by
having 10th grade geometry.</text><text start="1100.265" dur="3.804">Now, I&amp;#39;m not casting aspersions
among elementary educators,</text><text start="1104.069" dur="3.237">because they spend a lot of time
in their field understanding</text><text start="1107.306" dur="3.737">child development and growth and
learning, etcetera, etcetera.</text><text start="1111.043" dur="4.037">Math has not been one
of the things they do.</text><text start="1115.08" dur="3.003">Data literacy has not
been in the forefront of</text><text start="1118.083" dur="1.769">their education.</text><text start="1119.852" dur="2.502">So, are they data literate?</text><text start="1122.354" dur="2.736">And, if they aren&amp;#39;t, what
are we going to do about it?</text><text start="1125.09" dur="4.405">Okay? Then, we
have to look at the time.</text><text start="1129.495" dur="2.802">When are we going
to examine this data?</text><text start="1132.297" dur="2.57">When in my school day
am I going to do this?</text><text start="1134.867" dur="4.738">And, is anything going to
be done with what we found?</text><text start="1139.605" dur="4.804">I had one school that did not
want the Educator Dashboard,</text><text start="1144.409" dur="3.237">because they did not want to
know how many kids were at risk,</text><text start="1147.646" dur="2.903">because they
couldn&amp;#39;t deal with it.</text><text start="1150.549" dur="2.536">That works. Sure.</text><text start="1153.085" dur="3.036">All right.
Be ready to do something.</text><text start="1156.121" dur="4.438">So, we&amp;#39;re going to look at the
research from Dr. Robert Balfanz</text><text start="1160.559" dur="1.168">out of Johns Hopkins.</text><text start="1161.727" dur="6.039">And, he has done extensive
research on children at risk for</text><text start="1167.766" dur="4.304">disengaging in
their educational path.</text><text start="1172.07" dur="2.536">We&amp;#39;ve known them
as dropouts. Okay?</text><text start="1174.606" dur="4.038">But we know now, as early at
5th grade, who is at risk for</text><text start="1178.644" dur="1.635">dropping out.</text><text start="1180.279" dur="6.406">We even know, with the data, of
who is at risk in kindergarten</text><text start="1186.685" dur="4.838">by looking at the attendance
data in kindergarten.</text><text start="1191.523" dur="2.036">Do you know why?</text><text start="1193.559" dur="2.602">What five year old gets up and
gets dressed and comes to school</text><text start="1196.161" dur="1.335">on their own?</text><text start="1197.496" dur="1.468">I know you all did.</text><text start="1198.964" dur="3.07">Sure, because you&amp;#39;re
dedicated lifelong learners.</text><text start="1202.034" dur="1.668">How many of our kids do that?</text><text start="1203.702" dur="4.004">So, we get to look at the
attendance factors in elementary</text><text start="1207.706" dur="3.303">school, because that shows you
the culture and the value of</text><text start="1211.009" dur="3.203">education in the family and
the community in which they</text><text start="1214.212" dur="2.002">are growing.</text><text start="1217.549" dur="6.073">Balfanz discovered that the
ABC&amp;#39;s are attendance, behavior,</text><text start="1223.622" dur="2.502">and course grades.</text><text start="1226.124" dur="1.035">They are not separate.</text><text start="1227.159" dur="2.135">They are intertwined.</text><text start="1229.294" dur="4.104">You have to look at them,
but these are the vitals of a</text><text start="1233.398" dur="4.238">healthy educational system.</text><text start="1237.636" dur="3.07">We all have vitals, and when we
go to the doctor, that they have</text><text start="1240.706" dur="4.938">learned your temperature, your
heart rate, your blood pressure</text><text start="1245.644" dur="1.902">are your vitals.</text><text start="1247.546" dur="3.703">Because if anything is going on
in your body that is amiss, it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1251.249" dur="5.706">going to manifest
itself in your vitals. Correct?</text><text start="1256.955" dur="3.47">These are the vitals for
education, attendance, behavior,</text><text start="1260.425" dur="2.336">and course grades.</text><text start="1262.761" dur="4.271">This shows you how healthy
your educational system is.</text><text start="1267.032" dur="4.137">So, this is the data you&amp;#39;re
going to want to look at first.</text><text start="1271.169" dur="1.235">Are you collecting this data?</text><text start="1272.404" dur="5.005">If the student is not in
school, how can they learn?</text><text start="1280.746" dur="3.603">But if they&amp;#39;re not learning, why
do they want to come to school?</text><text start="1284.349" dur="1.502">Which comes first?</text><text start="1285.851" dur="2.035">We have a lot of students,
and you have to understand</text><text start="1287.886" dur="2.536">human nature.</text><text start="1290.422" dur="5.005">Human nature would rather
look bad than stupid. Okay?</text><text start="1298.53" dur="1.401">And our kids are at that point.</text><text start="1299.931" dur="6.107">They learn very, very early that
they would rather be bad and be</text><text start="1306.038" dur="5.839">known as a bad guy, or a
goof-off, or a comedian, than,</text><text start="1311.877" dur="5.338">&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t read,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t
do the math,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t sit</text><text start="1317.215" dur="2.169">still.&amp;quot; All right?</text><text start="1319.384" dur="1.969">So, which comes first?</text><text start="1322.487" dur="3.704">They want to come to school, but
they don&amp;#39;t want to look stupid</text><text start="1326.191" dur="1.034">so they act out.</text><text start="1327.225" dur="2.269">So, they become
acting out individuals.</text><text start="1329.494" dur="2.703">The data is
speaking for the child.</text><text start="1332.197" dur="3.504">The child is not going to come
to school and tell you, &amp;quot;Oh, you</text><text start="1335.701" dur="2.535">know, I feel like I&amp;#39;m not
successful at any part of the</text><text start="1338.236" dur="1.068">school day.</text><text start="1339.304" dur="4.304">And so, therefore, if I act out,
I can spend most of my day in</text><text start="1343.608" dur="2.403">the principal&amp;#39;s office.</text><text start="1346.011" dur="3.136">And then, I don&amp;#39;t have to deal
with Mrs. Flaherty&amp;#39;s Social</text><text start="1349.147" dur="2.169">Studies class.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1351.316" dur="0.868">The kid is not
going to tell you that.</text><text start="1352.184" dur="3.169">That&amp;#39;s way too sophisticated.</text><text start="1355.353" dur="3.571">But when he suddenly
acts out the period before</text><text start="1358.924" dur="3.603">Mrs. Flaherty&amp;#39;s Social Studies
class, and he does it every day</text><text start="1362.527" dur="3.37">for two weeks,
what&amp;#39;s the data tell you?</text><text start="1365.897" dur="4.205">That there&amp;#39;s something
about 10:00 o&amp;#39;clock. You know?</text><text start="1370.102" dur="3.236">So, these are our vitals.</text><text start="1373.338" dur="3.17">Make sure you look at this, look
at your data, see that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1376.508" dur="3.737">collecting this, and how deeply
the data you want to go, because</text><text start="1380.245" dur="1.635">this is what&amp;#39;s
going to tell you.</text><text start="1381.88" dur="4.671">Now, in our Educator Dashboard,
this is what we monitor, and</text><text start="1386.551" dur="6.273">this is what is displayed
in red, green, or yellow.</text><text start="1392.824" dur="1.502">Very, very easy.</text><text start="1394.326" dur="4.771">So, therefore, when you have
data literacy issues, make the</text><text start="1399.097" dur="5.706">data representation as easy as
possible, because everybody gets</text><text start="1404.803" dur="4.237">red means danger, Will Robinson.</text><text start="1409.04" dur="1.836">Green means we&amp;#39;re good to go.</text><text start="1410.876" dur="2.602">Yellow means we
can go either way.</text><text start="1413.478" dur="2.469">We have a downward trend. Okay?</text><text start="1415.947" dur="4.471">So, look at your data, and see
how well you can represent it.</text><text start="1431.63" dur="2.002">So, now, are you
collecting that?</text><text start="1433.632" dur="4.337">Are you collecting that data?</text><text start="1437.969" dur="1.535">Look at what
you&amp;#39;ve already got going.</text><text start="1439.504" dur="2.536">Don&amp;#39;t reinvent the wheel.</text><text start="1442.04" dur="3.971">Talk about what you&amp;#39;ve got,
and inventory those data</text><text start="1446.011" dur="2.302">points collected.</text><text start="1448.313" dur="4.605">So, if we have Jack, who doesn&amp;#39;t
want to come to Mrs. Flaherty&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1453.185" dur="2.936">Social Studies class,
do we collect that data?</text><text start="1458.557" dur="1.468">How do we do that?</text><text start="1460.025" dur="2.068">Who does that?</text><text start="1462.093" dur="0.801">Is it a clerk?</text><text start="1462.894" dur="1.969">You get the idea?</text><text start="1466.364" dur="3.37">If I want to know how many
half-days we have, do we collect</text><text start="1469.734" dur="3.07">half-day absences, or do
we just collect full days?</text><text start="1472.804" dur="3.437">I know this is logical, but it&amp;#39;s
like, if it&amp;#39;s in the PowerPoint,</text><text start="1476.241" dur="2.836">then you can say I&amp;#39;ve
got to look at it. All right?</text><text start="1479.077" dur="2.736">But, also, you have
to look at the fidelity.</text><text start="1481.813" dur="2.002">How accurate is it?</text><text start="1484.983" dur="5.505">Are the teachers uploading this
information daily, or are they</text><text start="1490.488" dur="4.105">recalling it on Friday afternoon
before they leave, because they</text><text start="1494.593" dur="3.169">have to submit their reports
before they can go home for</text><text start="1497.762" dur="2.002">the weekend?</text><text start="1501.8" dur="4.171">So, how valid is it?</text><text start="1505.971" dur="4.537">We had one school that had
tardies, that everybody that was</text><text start="1510.508" dur="3.838">tardy was treated equally,
whether they were tardy for two</text><text start="1514.346" dur="5.005">minutes, or whether they were
tardy for two and a half hours.</text><text start="1519.351" dur="3.103">They&amp;#39;re all equal,
because tardy is tardy.</text><text start="1522.454" dur="2.702">How valid is that?</text><text start="1525.156" dur="3.137">A student who is never, ever
tardy, and then all of a sudden</text><text start="1528.293" dur="6.073">is tardy three days in
one week, what&amp;#39;s going on?</text><text start="1534.366" dur="1.768">Yes. Mom had a cold.</text><text start="1536.134" dur="2.803">&amp;quot;I took Nyquil,
and I didn&amp;#39;t wake up.</text><text start="1538.937" dur="1.335">It wasn&amp;#39;t his fault he was late.</text><text start="1540.272" dur="5.572">It was because I was incapable
of driving at the time.&amp;quot; Okay?</text><text start="1545.844" dur="3.236">But guess who had
to serve detention?</text><text start="1549.08" dur="2.002">The boy who was late.</text><text start="1552.651" dur="3.003">So, at that point in time, I
was trying to teach this middle</text><text start="1555.654" dur="3.503">school child, my son,
about responsibility.</text><text start="1559.157" dur="1.969">Accept responsibility.</text><text start="1561.126" dur="2.169">If you did it,
there are consequences for</text><text start="1563.295" dur="0.8">your responsibilities.</text><text start="1564.095" dur="2.203">You&amp;#39;ve all had that talk. Right?</text><text start="1566.298" dur="1.935">So, he says to me, &amp;quot;So, fine.</text><text start="1568.233" dur="4.538">You overslept, and now I
have to serve detention.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1572.771" dur="0.667">I said, &amp;quot;No.</text><text start="1573.438" dur="2.135">I&amp;#39;ll serve detention with you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1575.573" dur="2.603">So, I went in, and
I served detention.</text><text start="1578.176" dur="5.839">Oh, he was so embarrassed, but
I sat in the office after school</text><text start="1584.015" dur="0.901">and did my work.</text><text start="1584.916" dur="5.539">So, we&amp;#39;re
talking about validity.</text><text start="1590.455" dur="1.268">We&amp;#39;re talking about equity.</text><text start="1591.723" dur="4.071">We&amp;#39;re talking about looking
at the fidelity of your data.</text><text start="1595.794" dur="5.005">Now, all of this is being done
before you do anything else.</text><text start="1604.869" dur="2.136">This is still for you,
the leader, to do.</text><text start="1610.842" dur="2.97">When you look at...
Can you see David Ronka?</text><text start="1613.812" dur="0.934">It&amp;#39;s not Fobb.</text><text start="1614.746" dur="5.005">It&amp;#39;s Robb Geier
and Mr. Marciniak.</text><text start="1622.988" dur="1.234">Those are leaders.</text><text start="1624.222" dur="2.87">Especially when you want to

going to support the vision.</text><text start="2397.228" dur="2.202">You&amp;#39;ve got 20% of them.</text><text start="2399.43" dur="5.505">Now, you&amp;#39;ve got your bottom 20%
that are so engrained in the</text><text start="2404.935" dur="4.471">culture of what they do, being
the kings and queens of their</text><text start="2409.406" dur="3.037">domain, because
they&amp;#39;ve seen it come.</text><text start="2412.443" dur="2.669">They&amp;#39;ve seen it go.</text><text start="2415.112" dur="4.004">Or, you have newbies that
just don&amp;#39;t know how to change,</text><text start="2419.116" dur="1.769">because, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so new.</text><text start="2420.885" dur="1.768">I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing.</text><text start="2422.653" dur="2.402">I&amp;#39;m just trying to

your 20% at the bottom. Okay?</text><text start="2429.894" dur="5.238">Because they&amp;#39;re so overwhelmed
they don&amp;#39;t know what else to do.</text><text start="2435.132" dur="2.803">So, you&amp;#39;ve got this
60% in the middle.</text><text start="2437.935" dur="1.969">There&amp;#39;s your fodder.</text><text start="2439.904" dur="2.135">These are the ones
you want to change.</text><text start="2442.039" dur="4.004">These are the ones that you want
to support, because you get them</text><text start="2446.043" dur="3.904">to the tipping point,
and you&amp;#39;re going to get over.</text><text start="2449.947" dur="6.64">So, pick your
teams from the top 20%.</text><text start="2456.587" dur="7.641">Pick your teams, have people
from the middle, that they&amp;#39;re on</text><text start="2464.228" dur="6.94">the fence people, and pick one
person from your bottom 20%,</text><text start="2471.168" dur="4.438">because they&amp;#39;re going
to keep you anchored. Okay?</text><text start="2475.606" dur="4.238">Because, if you can change that
one from the bottom 20%, you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2479.844" dur="4.471">on your way, but if you aren&amp;#39;t,
then you have to change your</text><text start="2484.315" dur="2.869">plan, because the data is
telling you it&amp;#39;s not working.</text><text start="2487.184" dur="2.036">Right? You see what I mean?</text><text start="2489.22" dur="5.005">So, if you want a valid...a
working group, look at your...</text><text start="2496.861" dur="1.067">look at your information.</text><text start="2497.928" dur="2.002">Look at your demographics.</text><text start="2501.332" dur="1.201">Ask for volunteers.</text><text start="2502.533" dur="5.939">You know the ones you can go

and accountability, because they</text><text start="2533.063" dur="3.103">become leaders as well. Right?</text><text start="2536.166" dur="2.47">Am I telling you anything new?</text><text start="2538.636" dur="3.603">You know this, but it&amp;#39;s nice to
hear somebody validate it for</text><text start="2542.239" dur="2.703">you. Right? Okay.</text><text start="2544.942" dur="3.637">There&amp;#39;s also a good book out
there called Switch, by Chip and</text><text start="2548.579" dur="1.768">Dan Heath.</text><text start="2550.347" dur="6.974">If you have not read it, put it
in your library, or check out</text><text start="2557.321" dur="1.201">the website.</text><text start="2558.522" dur="4.304">It gives you pretty much what&amp;#39;s
in the book, and it&amp;#39;s about</text><text start="2562.826" dur="3.838">changing in a culture that
doesn&amp;#39;t want to change.</text><text start="2566.664" dur="2.102">Very easy reading.</text><text start="2568.766" dur="1.868">I get it on audio books.</text><text start="2570.634" dur="1.602">So, it helps when I&amp;#39;m biking.</text><text start="2572.236" dur="2.903">Okay? So, do that.</text><text start="2575.139" dur="2.002">That&amp;#39;s going to help you.</text><text start="2578.809" dur="3.27">But, now, with your core

they need to do the job well.</text><text start="2601.465" dur="3.67">Make sure your

but usually it&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="2656.42" dur="1.034">Who does what?</text><text start="2657.454" dur="4.605">Now, we want you to
look at this, using data to</text><text start="2662.059" dur="2.936">improve schools.</text><text start="2664.995" dur="5.205">And, we have here, from REL,
a wonderful document called</text><text start="2670.2" dur="5.573">Toolkit for a Workshop on

files are to get all this</text><text start="2680.077" dur="3.136">information, but here it is.</text><text start="2683.213" dur="1.936">it&amp;#39;s right here, ready to go.</text><text start="2685.149" dur="2.402">They give you recommendations.</text><text start="2687.551" dur="1.902">They give you a slideshow.</text><text start="2689.453" dur="2.436">They give you modules.</text><text start="2691.889" dur="1.168">Hey, the wheel is round.</text><text start="2693.057" dur="1.701">Let&amp;#39;s use it. Okay?</text><text start="2694.758" dur="5.105">So, introducing
the culture of data.</text><text start="2699.863" dur="1.135">It&amp;#39;s here.</text><text start="2700.998" dur="2.936">If you want help
with it, REL is here.</text><text start="2703.934" dur="1.502">REL will help you.</text><text start="2705.436" dur="0.734">I will help you.</text><text start="2706.17" dur="3.136">The Department
will help you. Okay?</text><text start="2709.306" dur="2.536">So, like I said, it&amp;#39;s a toolkit.</text><text start="2711.842" dur="5.339">It&amp;#39;s ready to go, but you must
have an executive champion that</text><text start="2717.181" dur="2.569">sanctions it.</text><text start="2719.75" dur="4.204">That says, &amp;quot;Go.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2723.954" dur="3.403">And, it&amp;#39;s kind of like they
coronate you and they bless you,</text><text start="2727.357" dur="4.105">that you are the leader, because
otherwise you&amp;#39;re a loose cannon.</text><text start="2733.597" dur="3.136">Here&amp;#39;s what we want the
superintendent to do.</text><text start="2736.733" dur="2.67">You have to give them
expectations, because these</text><text start="2739.403" dur="1.201">people are CEO&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="2740.604" dur="2.769">They have a lot of stuff to do.</text><text start="2743.373" dur="2.236">There&amp;#39;s many things
that...they&amp;#39;re managers, they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2745.609" dur="6.24">labor advocates, they are
negotiators, etcetera, etcetera,</text><text start="2751.849" dur="3.703">but they will meet you, if
you give them, &amp;quot;This is what I</text><text start="2755.552" dur="1.769">expect of you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2757.321" dur="2.035">And, most times,
they&amp;#39;ll meet you on it.</text><text start="2759.356" dur="4.104">And, if they don&amp;#39;t, then you
know what you&amp;#39;re dealing with.</text><text start="2767.998" dur="2.236">Get your school board on
board, because, you know why?</text><text start="2770.234" dur="2.903">Pennsylvania is a
locally controlled system.</text><text start="2773.137" dur="1.534">You know what that means?</text><text start="2774.671" dur="1.802">It&amp;#39;s a local decision.</text><text start="2776.473" dur="3.537">How many times have you called
PDE, and they say, &amp;quot;Well, it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2780.01" dur="3.203">local decision,&amp;quot; and you think
it&amp;#39;s because we don&amp;#39;t want to</text><text start="2783.213" dur="2.102">tell you.</text><text start="2785.315" dur="3.437">We can&amp;#39;t tell you.</text><text start="2788.752" dur="2.703">I have people that want me to
give them a scope and sequence</text><text start="2791.455" dur="3.57">for Social Studies, from
kindergarten to 12th grade.</text><text start="2795.025" dur="1.735">I can&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="2796.76" dur="1.935">I can give you recommendations.</text><text start="2798.695" dur="4.738">I can give you examples, but if
I give you a scope and sequence,</text><text start="2803.433" dur="5.106">then it becomes a state required
scope and sequence, and it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2808.539" dur="2.836">local decision.</text><text start="2811.375" dur="2.803">That gives you great latitude.</text><text start="2814.178" dur="3.737">It is a local choice, based on
the culture of your community,</text><text start="2817.915" dur="4.771">what decisions you make for
the education of your students.</text><text start="2822.686" dur="4.304">Get your school
board on board. Okay?</text><text start="2826.99" dur="3.504">Relate to them, because most of
your community members that are</text><text start="2830.494" dur="1.568">on board use real-time data.</text><text start="2832.062" dur="6.64">And, your school board people
use data for their sales, their</text><text start="2838.702" dur="3.403">businessmen in the community,
their business women.</text><text start="2842.105" dur="5.139">They live in a data world, even
though they may not know it, and</text><text start="2847.244" dur="3.737">they may think the schools work
that way, too, because they</text><text start="2850.981" dur="2.002">don&amp;#39;t know what
they don&amp;#39;t know. Right?</text><text start="2854.918" dur="2.936">Get them on board as your
allies, because they&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="2857.854" dur="3.27">be the ones that are going
to give you time allocation.</text><text start="2861.124" dur="2.47">They&amp;#39;re going to be the ones
that will give you funds.</text><text start="2863.594" dur="2.235">They&amp;#39;re going to give you the
ones that give you the go ahead</text><text start="2865.829" dur="5.005">to say, &amp;quot;This is
important.&amp;quot; Okay.</text><text start="2874.738" dur="3.003">We&amp;#39;re good with this so far?</text><text start="2877.741" dur="3.67">All of this is done
before you even have a meeting.</text><text start="2883.447" dur="1.968">You&amp;#39;re sharpening your axe.</text><text start="2885.415" dur="5.94">Abraham Lincoln, who took me
to the prom, all right, he said</text><text start="2891.355" dur="5.505">that if he had to chop down a
tree, he would spend nine hours</text><text start="2896.86" dur="4.605">sharpening his axe, and the
rest of the time cutting down</text><text start="2901.465" dur="2.402">the tree.</text><text start="2903.867" dur="2.836">Prepare, prepare, prepare.</text><text start="2906.703" dur="3.203">So, at this time, now
you have a team leader.</text><text start="2909.906" dur="2.236">Now, maybe you&amp;#39;re going to
assign somebody else to be the</text><text start="2912.142" dur="0.834">team leader.</text><text start="2912.976" dur="2.903">You have a cultural
leader, the team leader.</text><text start="2915.879" dur="3.036">Maybe it&amp;#39;s you, but leaders
need to know exactly what their</text><text start="2918.915" dur="1.502">responsibilities are.</text><text start="2920.417" dur="1.101">And, guess what?</text><text start="2921.518" dur="3.537">Some people do not know that the
leader sets the meeting times.</text><text start="2927.491" dur="1.735">Yes. It&amp;#39;s like, I know.</text><text start="2929.226" dur="1.334">You think, well, they know that.</text><text start="2930.56" dur="2.536">But if they knew
that, they would do it.</text><text start="2933.096" dur="1.869">But, when it&amp;#39;s written down,
then you can say, &amp;quot;Well,</text><text start="2934.965" dur="2.269">remember, you&amp;#39;re supposed
to set the meetings times.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2937.234" dur="3.17">Okay? They set the agenda.</text><text start="2940.404" dur="4.471">They establish the norms and the
protocol, just as I said that</text><text start="2944.875" dur="4.971">the faculty meetings
start with data now.</text><text start="2949.846" dur="2.002">The team leader does that.</text><text start="2953.583" dur="2.703">And, of course, you are
providing that safe atmosphere</text><text start="2956.286" dur="2.669">for discussion.</text><text start="2958.955" dur="3.27">And that takes an active leader.</text><text start="2962.225" dur="1.368">I have one school.</text><text start="2963.593" dur="4.371">It&amp;#39;s a very small school that I
know of, that their SAP [Student</text><text start="2967.964" dur="2.002">Assistance Program] team is
a gossip session, because</text><text start="2969.966" dur="1.869">everybody knows everybody else.</text><text start="2971.835" dur="4.137">And, it turns into, &amp;quot;Oh, well,
do you know that she did?</text><text start="2975.972" dur="0.935">And they did this.</text><text start="2976.907" dur="2.436">And now, what&amp;#39;s the
kid going to do?&amp;quot; No.</text><text start="2979.343" dur="4.504">That has nothing to do with the
facts at hand, and it was up to</text><text start="2983.847" dur="4.271">the team leader to stop it
and create a professional</text><text start="2988.118" dur="6.873">atmosphere, and not
a gossip session. Okay?</text><text start="2994.991" dur="5.005">Deliberate action, hard work,
determination produce an</text><text start="2999.996" dur="0.835">effective team.</text><text start="3000.831" dur="3.069">That sounds like
the American way.</text><text start="3003.9" dur="0.901">Doesn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="3004.801" dur="3.904">Hard work, determination,</text><text start="3008.705" dur="1.769">it&amp;#39;s what we do.</text><text start="3010.474" dur="5.472">Now, also, we&amp;#39;ve got here a
team meeting agenda template.</text><text start="3015.946" dur="3.57">So, you can just fill this

anything bad, because, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3066.096" dur="1.902">not my nature. No.</text><text start="3067.998" dur="1.234">That&amp;#39;s my role.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3069.232" dur="3.704">Let&amp;#39;s look for the obvious,

about like taking Washington</text><text start="3117.647" dur="3.037">State off of it and put
Pennsylvania on there, but I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3120.684" dur="1.835">not doing that.</text><text start="3122.519" dur="0.968">All right?</text><text start="3123.487" dur="1.634">But it&amp;#39;s a great tool kit.</text><text start="3125.121" dur="0.968">Here it is.</text><text start="3126.089" dur="1.668">Get your team leader.</text><text start="3127.757" dur="1.569">Get your team together.</text><text start="3129.326" dur="3.003">Go through this, so you&amp;#39;re all
on the same page, and you all</text><text start="3132.329" dur="6.072">use the same vocabulary, so that
everybody knows, when we speak</text><text start="3138.401" dur="3.604">about this, this is what
we mean in this district.</text><text start="3142.005" dur="2.669">And you use that
through tool kit.</text><text start="3144.674" dur="6.74">The other one that works is
Using Data to Improve Schools.</text><text start="3151.414" dur="6.607">Okay? And, this
is a great source.</text><text start="3158.021" dur="4.004">And, again, it is from the
Department of Ed, I believe.</text><text start="3162.025" dur="4.037">No, the American Association
of School Administrators.</text><text start="3166.062" dur="2.369">But, again, it&amp;#39;s in chapters.</text><text start="3168.431" dur="3.037">Why data matters.</text><text start="3171.468" dur="3.97">And it gives you handouts
and work and schedules, and</text><text start="3175.438" dur="3.637">everything you need to
put together professional</text><text start="3179.075" dur="5.439">development for
using data in schools.</text><text start="3184.514" dur="0.968">Don&amp;#39;t reinvent the wheel.</text><text start="3185.482" dur="2.769">Here it is. Okay?</text><text start="3188.251" dur="6.307">We also have Data Team Meetings,
Steps and Structures, from the</text><text start="3194.558" dur="4.27">Center for Performance
Assessment for data teams, and</text><text start="3198.828" dur="4.905">it gives you everything that
you need to help your data team</text><text start="3203.733" dur="5.806">organize here.</text><text start="3209.539" dur="0.067">This is what the Washington
State Tool Kit used.</text><text start="3213.343" dur="4.605">You&amp;#39;re also going to see
repeatedly this cycle.</text><text start="3217.948" dur="6.773">Now, going through your course
of study to get where you are,</text><text start="3224.721" dur="1.902">you&amp;#39;ve seen this before.</text><text start="3226.623" dur="2.602">You know this.</text><text start="3229.225" dur="3.137">Other people in your teams may
not see this and don&amp;#39;t work</text><text start="3232.362" dur="2.803">this way.</text><text start="3235.165" dur="3.503">Do not assume that just because
they have a Master&amp;#39;s degree that</text><text start="3238.668" dur="2.002">they have gone through
this course of study.</text><text start="3245.508" dur="5.606">Help them articulate
questions, identify the data.</text><text start="3251.114" dur="3.337">Are you going to give them the
data you&amp;#39;re going to look at?</text><text start="3254.451" dur="2.602">Are we going to look at the
issue, and then decide what data</text><text start="3257.053" dur="1.802">to look at?</text><text start="3258.855" dur="3.403">Choices for your data team.</text><text start="3262.258" dur="4.872">Okay? Understand the issues.</text><text start="3267.13" dur="3.537">If you are looking at
alternative ed programs, then</text><text start="3270.667" dur="3.27">you want to have a team that&amp;#39;s
going to understand the issues</text><text start="3273.937" dur="6.339">of community, and challenges for
students who are not engaged.</text><text start="3280.276" dur="4.138">Because if you treat those
kids like they&amp;#39;re typical</text><text start="3284.414" dur="2.436">learners...Have you ever
worked with those kids that</text><text start="3286.85" dur="2.235">are disengaged?</text><text start="3289.085" dur="1.802">They&amp;#39;re not your
typical learners.</text><text start="3290.887" dur="2.636">If they were, they
would be successful.</text><text start="3293.523" dur="2.703">So, when you&amp;#39;re looking at
students who are disengaged and</text><text start="3296.226" dur="4.204">not successful, you have
to treat them as they are.</text><text start="3300.43" dur="3.937">They&amp;#39;re different, because
otherwise, it&amp;#39;s a whole lot like</text><text start="3304.367" dur="2.736">waving to Stevie Wonder.</text><text start="3307.103" dur="4.672">You feel good about it,
but he doesn&amp;#39;t care. Okay?</text><text start="3311.775" dur="2.035">So, think about that.</text><text start="3313.81" dur="2.002">Thanks for getting that.</text><text start="3318.214" dur="6.974">Victoria Bernhardt is another
area of research that shows you</text><text start="3325.188" dur="5.005">the different layers
to disaggregate data.</text><text start="3332.228" dur="4.138">Now, I know you know this,
because that&amp;#39;s why you are where</text><text start="3336.366" dur="5.138">you are, but, again, other
people don&amp;#39;t know how to peel</text><text start="3341.504" dur="4.104">the layers, how to get through
the parfait to get to the gooey</text><text start="3345.608" dur="4.872">good stuff at the bottom. Right?</text><text start="3350.48" dur="4.338">So, Victoria Bernhardt is there
to provide those questions.</text><text start="3354.818" dur="5.005">Now, we also have root cause
analysis, and this comes out of</text><text start="3362.225" dur="5.005">the Washington State
Tool Kit, that gives you how</text><text start="3367.23" dur="1.702">to do the analysis.</text><text start="3368.932" dur="3.637">How do you look at root cause?</text><text start="3372.569" dur="4.204">How do you get to
the bottom of it?</text><text start="3376.773" dur="3.67">We had a girl one time, I heard
about a girl that was late every</text><text start="3380.443" dur="1.302">day for school.</text><text start="3381.745" dur="3.103">She came to school every day,
secondary, at 9:30 in the</text><text start="3384.848" dur="3.203">morning, every day, 9:30.</text><text start="3388.051" dur="1.802">She had in-school suspension.</text><text start="3389.853" dur="2.736">She still came to school at
9:30 in the morning, every day.</text><text start="3395.225" dur="2.469">They gave her
out-of-school suspension.</text><text start="3397.694" dur="4.504">She still came to
school every day at 9:30.</text><text start="3402.198" dur="4.071">They fined, every
day at 9:30. Nothing.</text><text start="3406.269" dur="5.072">None of the consequences
deterred the tardiness, until</text><text start="3411.341" dur="3.503">finally, in the exhaustive
approach that they did that was</text><text start="3414.844" dur="5.306">on record and policy, she
was sent to AEDY, costing the</text><text start="3420.15" dur="3.536">district money.</text><text start="3423.686" dur="4.805">Until, finally, somebody asked
her why she was late every day</text><text start="3428.491" dur="1.802">at 9:30.</text><text start="3430.293" dur="2.536">She said, &amp;quot;My mom
works night work.</text><text start="3432.829" dur="3.203">She doesn&amp;#39;t get home until
8:00 in the morning, and</text><text start="3436.032" dur="1.869">she&amp;#39;s exhausted.</text><text start="3437.901" dur="3.303">I get my younger brother and
sister up, and take them to</text><text start="3441.204" dur="3.37">elementary school, so I know
they&amp;#39;re safe, and then I come</text><text start="3444.574" dur="2.002">to school.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3447.911" dur="4.604">Now, how did it get to that
point, before you started</text><text start="3452.515" dur="2.469">looking at the
questions for the data?</text><text start="3457.086" dur="3.137">Start looking for the
gooey center at the bottom of</text><text start="3460.223" dur="2.603">the parfait.</text><text start="3462.826" dur="3.67">Sometimes you don&amp;#39;t have to go
that far, but it&amp;#39;s so worth it</text><text start="3466.496" dur="1.234">when you get there.</text><text start="3467.73" dur="2.002">All right?</text><text start="3474.504" dur="6.206">It&amp;#39;s not necessarily the
answers that are important.</text><text start="3480.71" dur="2.769">It&amp;#39;s the discussion.</text><text start="3483.479" dur="4.271">When do you have an opportunity
to sit with your peers and talk</text><text start="3487.75" dur="4.705">in a professional format, with a
professional discussion, to look</text><text start="3492.455" dur="2.002">at issues?</text><text start="3495.491" dur="1.669">When was the last
time you did that?</text><text start="3497.16" dur="0.667">Oh, yes.</text><text start="3497.827" dur="1.969">I came to the conference.</text><text start="3499.796" dur="2.335">And, the conference is two days,
and now you&amp;#39;re going to go back.</text><text start="3502.131" dur="2.97">And, are you going to
debrief with somebody?</text><text start="3505.101" dur="2.269">Is it going to be official?</text><text start="3507.37" dur="2.035">Are you just going to...
like, over lunch, we talked</text><text start="3509.405" dur="1.435">about this?</text><text start="3510.84" dur="2.302">The discussion is
what&amp;#39;s important.</text><text start="3513.142" dur="2.47">It&amp;#39;s always
beginning the discussion.</text><text start="3518.414" dur="5.739">Once you know,
what do you do? Okay?</text><text start="3524.153" dur="2.436">Plan and take action.</text><text start="3526.589" dur="2.536">There is no sense in knowing
something, if you&amp;#39;re not going</text><text start="3529.125" dur="5.405">to do anything about it. Okay?</text><text start="3534.53" dur="4.772">Do you know the phrase
&amp;quot;ignorance is bliss?&amp;quot; Yes?</text><text start="3539.302" dur="1.768">Where did that phrase come from?</text><text start="3541.07" dur="5.005">Back when I was dating James
Garfield, in 1881, he was shot</text><text start="3555.018" dur="1.668">in the train station.</text><text start="3556.686" dur="2.669">He was shot in the back. Okay?</text><text start="3559.355" dur="1.368">But he did not die right away.</text><text start="3560.723" dur="5.039">And, in fact, today, he would
not have died at all, as we saw</text><text start="3565.762" dur="1.301">with Ronald Reagan.</text><text start="3567.063" dur="2.302">No, I didn&amp;#39;t date him,
because I didn&amp;#39;t like Nancy.</text><text start="3569.365" dur="4.972">So, James Garfield was shot in
the back, and it was just at</text><text start="3576.806" dur="5.539">that time in life when they
started looking at germs, these</text><text start="3582.345" dur="3.637">microscopic things
that could kill you.</text><text start="3585.982" dur="6.173">But, yet, the Victorian medical
people thought that, &amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3592.155" dur="5.138">exist if I can&amp;#39;t see it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3597.293" dur="3.871">James Lister, from England, was
in the United States, and had</text><text start="3601.164" dur="4.604">talked at a conference about
a simple thing you could do is</text><text start="3605.768" dur="3.07">wash your hands
before examining a patient.</text><text start="3611.474" dur="5.005">Doctor Bliss, was his name,
was the lead doctor for James</text><text start="3616.479" dur="5.005">Garfield&amp;#39;s medical team, and he
said that was bunk, and he came</text><text start="3623.72" dur="4.738">right in off the street and
probed the wound with his</text><text start="3628.458" dur="2.002">bare hand.</text><text start="3631.461" dur="2.903">Of course, after he had petted
the horse and tied up the horse</text><text start="3634.364" dur="2.002">and the carriage. Right?</text><text start="3637.9" dur="3.704">James Garfield did
not die from his wounds.</text><text start="3641.604" dur="3.704">He died from the medical
practice that tried to save him.</text><text start="3647.744" dur="2.068">Ignorance is bliss.</text><text start="3653.249" dur="2.336">Plan and take action.</text><text start="3657.954" dur="5.005">Do what needs to be done to
have a healthy and vital student</text><text start="3666.095" dur="3.37">engaged in education.</text><text start="3669.465" dur="1.569">Evaluate your results.</text><text start="3671.034" dur="0.934">Is it working?</text><text start="3671.968" dur="0.834">Take notes.</text><text start="3672.802" dur="3.337">If it&amp;#39;s not working,
guess who has to change?</text><text start="3676.139" dur="2.002">The adults.</text><text start="3678.141" dur="4.738">If you&amp;#39;re changing a culture,
you have to be the one that</text><text start="3682.879" dur="2.702">takes the actions.</text><text start="3685.581" dur="3.17">Talk about the expectations.</text><text start="3688.751" dur="4.305">When do you think teachers are
going to start looking at data?</text><text start="3693.056" dur="2.702">When is the team
going to get together?</text><text start="3695.758" dur="2.036">How often do
they have to do this?</text><text start="3697.794" dur="4.17">Has anybody ever sent a
teenager out to clean the car?</text><text start="3704.333" dur="4.138">Do they clean it to
your specifications? Why?</text><text start="3708.471" dur="1.868">I sent my son
out to clean the car.</text><text start="3710.339" dur="1.135">I said, &amp;quot;Clean the car out.</text><text start="3711.474" dur="1.735">It&amp;#39;s a mess.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3713.209" dur="2.469">My tires were so shiny.</text><text start="3715.678" dur="1.969">The inside still
had French fries.</text><text start="3717.647" dur="2.102">All right?</text><text start="3719.749" dur="2.569">What&amp;#39;s the expectation?</text><text start="3722.318" dur="4.738">Communicate it so that everybody
meets the expectations.</text><text start="3727.056" dur="5.239">Now, we&amp;#39;re going to
look at the interventions.</text><text start="3732.295" dur="3.403">We have an intervention catalog
in our Early Warning System, and</text><text start="3735.698" dur="2.436">in our Early Warning
System...I don&amp;#39;t have it.</text><text start="3738.134" dur="5.005">I gave it away...we have a REL
document called the Toolkit for</text><text start="3745.441" dur="2.903">Dropout Prevention, and
it&amp;#39;s up in their booth.</text><text start="3748.344" dur="1.168">It&amp;#39;s spiral bound.</text><text start="3749.512" dur="3.503">It&amp;#39;s green, and it is so cool.</text><text start="3753.015" dur="1.402">It has a checklist.</text><text start="3754.417" dur="3.603">It has recommendations, and it
has a checklist for each one of</text><text start="3758.02" dur="4.138">the recommendations, and how you
implement that in your school.</text><text start="3762.158" dur="4.071">Now, if it&amp;#39;s good for dropout,
it&amp;#39;s good for every student,</text><text start="3766.229" dur="2.469">every student, because we
want every student engaged.</text><text start="3768.698" dur="1.368">All right?</text><text start="3770.099" dur="2.736">And, sometimes, when we look for
interventions, we have to look</text><text start="3772.835" dur="2.002">at these five areas.</text><text start="3774.837" dur="4.305">You have to look at an
intervention that is systemic.</text><text start="3779.142" dur="2.469">Is it something we can change,
because our policies may</text><text start="3781.611" dur="1.935">be wrong?</text><text start="3783.546" dur="1.435">Is it social?</text><text start="3784.981" dur="4.237">Kids have graffiti
because it&amp;#39;s a social issue.</text><text start="3789.218" dur="1.702">They don&amp;#39;t have social skills.</text><text start="3790.92" dur="4.338">It&amp;#39;s academic, it&amp;#39;s
community, or it&amp;#39;s personal.</text><text start="3795.258" dur="2.636">Those are the areas to look
at when you&amp;#39;re looking at</text><text start="3797.894" dur="2.736">interventions
based from the data.</text><text start="3800.63" dur="6.006">Everybody has an intervention
catalog in their heads.</text><text start="3806.636" dur="4.07">Your school has resources
they go to regularly to help</text><text start="3810.706" dur="3.604">students, but it&amp;#39;s kept in
your head, and it&amp;#39;s kept in</text><text start="3814.31" dur="0.667">your head.</text><text start="3814.977" dur="2.303">And, collectively,
we have a catalog.</text><text start="3817.28" dur="3.103">What we are advocating for
you to do is write it down.</text><text start="3820.383" dur="3.904">We have a template and a
spreadsheet that you just fill</text><text start="3824.287" dur="6.072">out, and that is a composite
then of everybody&amp;#39;s knowledge.</text><text start="3830.359" dur="3.604">It can&amp;#39;t replace a person,
but it helps support it.</text><text start="3836.699" dur="2.903">So, look for
your resources. Okay?</text><text start="3839.602" dur="5.172">Make your data driven decisions,
and you are going to be looking</text><text start="3844.774" dur="3.336">for continuous improvement.</text><text start="3848.11" dur="4.105">I like looking at scoring
guides, because they are a self</text><text start="3852.215" dur="2.335">assessment. Okay?</text><text start="3854.55" dur="5.305">And this is from the Education
for the Future&amp;#39;s initiative.</text><text start="3859.855" dur="3.07">Look where you are, and it gives
you the roadmap of where you</text><text start="3862.925" dur="3.203">want to be, and
what it looks like.</text><text start="3866.128" dur="3.337">So that when I say, &amp;quot;Clean the
car,&amp;quot; it means get the French</text><text start="3869.465" dur="2.002">fries out of the back seat.</text><text start="3874.637" dur="5.238">Access to all training
