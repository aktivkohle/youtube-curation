That&amp;#39;s their choice</text><text start="588.98" dur="6.6">It&amp;#39;s a bit weird, they believe in Angels, Devils and Heaven</text><text start="595.58" dur="5.42">But they don&amp;#39;t believe in that or they believe it but label it as Devils</text><text start="601" dur="2">Basically biased</text><text start="603" dur="4.72">Yes, well, I don&amp;#39;t know everything in the Bible.</text><text start="607.72" dur="4.86">I think you should leave the dead in peace</text><text start="612.58" dur="7.5">Not that I am sure about but just a perspective</text><text start="620.08" dur="9.42">The contact with the dead goes through the Devil</text><text start="629.5" dur="3.46">But I&amp;#39;m not sure about that</text><text start="632.96" dur="7.44">But, you also have cases that the dead is reaching out to you, the opposite</text><text start="640.4" dur="5.22">Yes, they are very happy the dead can reach out</text><text start="645.62" dur="4.04">Each remain their character
