hunties and huncles. Did y&#39;all miss me? Ah, I miss y&#39;all. I know some of y&#39;all
missed your girl. I got comments like, &quot;LaToya,
when is season ten starting? We miss you.&quot; Well, I&#39;m back y&#39;all,
and it feels good. I was on a much needed break. Sometimes vlogging
gets overwhelming and at the time
we were traveling. We went to London, (upbeat music) Atlanta, LA (singing) San Francisco. We were invited to the
YouTube headquarters. Oh my gosh, I&#39;m so excited.
- Yes. Bahamas. (lively music) So many places. We felt like, &quot;Let&#39;s spend
this time just focusing on our friends and family and
we&#39;ll put out a vlog weekly as we travel.&quot; That&#39;s what we did. Now we are back and
we&#39;re so excited. Let me just tell you guys
what we&#39;re doing today. We&#39;re about to meet up
with Ayana and Grayson. Zayn and I are gonna
have a little play date. Samia&#39;s at daycare
right now running around and having fun with
her daycare friends, so Ayana and I are
gonna go out to eat and probably hit up a few
shops and get some clothes and cute-ify our
stuff and whatnot. Okay? Okay y&#39;all, so we&#39;re at
my favorite restaurant, Jack Astor&#39;s and I&#39;m with Ayana. - What&#39;s going on hunties? - [LaToya] You look so good. - Thank you. - [LaToya] This is
the best hairstyle. I know I say it
every time I see you but you look so hot.
- I appreciate it, thank you. - [LaToya] So sexy with
this hair, like fire. Hi, Grayson, hi. - [Ayana] Want to say hi
to the hunties and huncles? Say hi. - [LaToya] Oh, he&#39;s
(mumbles) that. - He&#39;s such a big boy. - [LaToya] Can you
say hi to the hunties? - Can you say hi auntie? Auntie, auntie Toya. You&#39;re so cute. - [LaToya] And Zayn ... Y&#39;all he scratched himself. Last night he was
throwing a tantrum. This guy throws tantrums whenever he doesn&#39;t get what
he wants he throws a tantrum. It&#39;s so great that
my best friend and I, we have kids that
are so close in age. - [Ayana] I know, it&#39;s so nice. - And they&#39;re gonna
grow up together. I always talk about this but I just feel so
blessed and lucky. I pray to God that
they&#39;re best friends. That Grayson and Zayn
are best friends. Anyways, I just
ordered a tuna poke, supposedly it&#39;s good. It&#39;s raw tuna and
you get it with some wanton chips,
crispy wanton chips. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll
test it out, we&#39;ll see. - Should be good. I didn&#39;t even get ... What the, what? - [LaToya] You&#39;re so hot. Hi Zayn. Zayn! He looks like a grown man
with his little expression. He&#39;s fresh right now in
his little white shirt. Look at you looking
like a grown man. What up dog? Looking like you&#39;re in a
business meeting right now, talking about hedge funds. How are we gonna make ... Oh, god, all right, okay. Were you smoking
too many cigars? This is how I have to eat. You get a pass because
he&#39;s under the weather. He&#39;s just getting over a cold. Granddaddy. I have to hold him
because if I put him down he&#39;s gonna while out. My kids are crazy. Both of them. They wanna do everything. - Who&#39;s their mom. Who&#39;s their mom? You guys know? Queen of babies. - Shut up. Anyways, bon appetit, y&#39;all. (funky music) - [Waitress] Dessert ladies? - [Ayana] Thank you. - [LaToya] Oh no, no thank you. - Hey guys, what is going on? - Hey! - I&#39;m here with the princess. - Ses. Or the queen, not a
princess, of course. - Queenses. (laughing) It&#39;s a new word started here. - That&#39;s our ship name. - Queenses. Anyways, I&#39;m super excited
about today&#39;s segment because, one, we haven&#39;t
done an update on Samia in a while. - Samia, is a little girl now.
- Samia is almost two years. She&#39;s almost two years. We are planning her birthday
so it&#39;s gonna be ... - Yep and she&#39;s gonna have
a princess theme party. I&#39;m so excited. - Like I said, Samia update, and it&#39;s special because we&#39;ve
partnered up with Pampers. - Pampers! - We got an exciting gift for you today baby.
- For Samia. - First update is,
Samia&#39;s super fashionable. She loves fashion. Every single day she goes
in this draw right here and she wants to wear her
princess dresses; her tutus. We have a dress full of
princess dresses for Samia. What&#39;s another update? - She has gone from
saying single words to much more structured sentences. Which is great. One of my favorite
updates of Samia is that she sleeps in her own
room; in her own bed, for the most part. Right about 6AM she
just starts crying and then we gotta
wake up and grab her and bring her to the
room for an hour. - Yes. - Which beats having her
there most of the night. - She loves cuddling with mommy. - I think another great
update is that now ... - She&#39;s potty training. Samia is finally potty training. No more changing poopy diapers. Yes! Oh, just kidding,
cause I have Zayn. Laud! Let&#39;s go ahead and open
up this special gift that Pampers sent Samia. - Exactly. - So excited. - Are you ready? I&#39;m gonna go get that for you.
- Get it. Just get it.
- I&#39;m gonna get it. - It&#39;s a surprise Samia. - [Adam] Samia are you
ready for the gift? - She&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m nervous.&quot; - [Adam] Are you ready? - Look at that big box. - All right Samia. Pampers has sent us this gift. We&#39;re gonna read this, okay? It says, &quot;Open me first.&quot; Oh! Dear Samia, an exciting
package just came in the mail from Pampers Easy Up and this
little letter has your name and a tale. It says, &quot;You should open
it in a minute or two for inside you&#39;ll find
something special for you.&quot; We&#39;re so happy for you. It&#39;s an exciting day. - [LaToya] Woo, hi baby. - Good-Bye to diapers
is what you&#39;ll soon say. We can sing a happy song, we can do a silly dance because today you&#39;re
getting your first Pamper Easy Ups Training Pants. If you&#39;re excited to see inside, there&#39;s a special
phrase we want to share. Say, &quot;I&#39;m ready for underwear.&quot; She&#39;s ready for underwear. All right, congratulations
from Pampers Easy Up. All right, Samia, let&#39;s open it. Pull it, pull it. Ooh. - [LaToya] Open the present. - Come Samia, open. - Open the present baby. - Ooh. - [LaToya] Ooh, you love
opening up gifts, don&#39;t you? Wonder what&#39;s in that green box. - Can you rip it Samia? - [LaToya] It
matches your shirt. Whoa. - Good job. - She&#39;s so excited.
- Okay. What&#39;s inside of here? - Oh my gosh! Pampers Easy Ups
Training Underwear. Samia you&#39;re a big girl now! - Look Samia. - [LaToya] Oh my gosh. - Yay! - [LaToya] Oh my gosh. My baby&#39;s growing up. - Mama, these are mine. - [LaToya] Yeah, that&#39;s yours. Do you want to try one on baby? - Pampers Easy Ups. - [LaToya] She
Goes, &quot;Open Please.&quot; Open?
- Dora. - [LaToya and Adam] Dora! - Yes, you know Dora. - [LaToya] 23
training underwear. - Ooh Dora. - Oh wow. It feels like an
actual underwear. - Yeah, it does. - It feels like her
Pampers Swimmers that she has as well.
- Oh, she&#39;s getting ready. - Look at her, look at her,
look at her, look at her. She&#39;s so excited. - You wanna put it on? - She&#39;s like, &quot;Thank god, no
more big underwear anymore.&quot; See ya later diapers. Oh my gosh, there so soft. Here, it&#39;s like an underwear. Oh wow, bubs, look at that. - [Adam] Transitioning
to underwear is definitely a big deal. It&#39;s a big step for
Samia and for any toddler so we&#39;re excited that
we were able to do this in a fun way with her. Shout out to Pampers
for reaching out and collaborating with us. She&#39;s definitely gonna
think it&#39;s underwear. She&#39;s making that big
step, that big move. - [LaToya] Next up
is Zayn&#39;s update. - Yes, Samia&#39;s gonna help
me with Zayn&#39;s update. - [LaToya] Are you
gonna help daddy? - All right y&#39;all, so I&#39;m in
the car with my cousin, Milan. - Hey y&#39;all. - Isn&#39;t she super cute. - Stop. - She looks 12, but she&#39;s 18. Can you believe it
- Embarrassing. that you&#39;re so old now? - So old, but look lie I&#39;m two. - I know. You&#39;re an adult, but your mom
doesn&#39;t treat you like one. - No, she treats me
like I&#39;m six years old, the way that I look. We&#39;re about to go
get some piercings to show that I&#39;m my age. - Oh my god. No, listen. Y&#39;all, I&#39;m so nervous
right now because her mom doesn&#39;t know
that we&#39;re going. I feel bad. - I don&#39;t feel bad. - I don&#39;t feel bad,
I just feel like, should I tell her ... That we&#39;re going? I&#39;m doing this without
her permission. Your her child,
your not my child - True
- and I&#39;m taking you to get your ears pierced. I thought that she knew. When I was like, &quot;Milan
does your mom know?&quot; She was like, &quot;She knows, but she didn&#39;t know that
we were going today.&quot; She doesn&#39;t know that
we&#39;re going today. I&#39;m like ... - She&#39;ll find out. What&#39;s she gonna say? Take it out?
- What, yes! - No, she can&#39;t say that, man. It&#39;s my ears. Right here. - Listen, now that you turned 18 you&#39;re a little sassy
little girl huh? Anyways, I want to get
my nose re-pierced. - Which is gonna kill. - I know because I&#39;m
piercing through scar tissue and when I try to
poke my hole back in, like poke an earring
through the hole, it was not going through. It went half way, but
it didn&#39;t bust open. I didn&#39;t bust it wide open, yo. (laughing) - Y&#39;all, no, I can&#39;t do this. This is all wrong. I can&#39;t go in there. I can not take you to get
your freaking ears pierced without your mom knowing. I can&#39;t do it. This is terrible. - I&#39;m taking myself. - You&#39;re not taking yourself. I&#39;m in the freaking
driver&#39;s seat. I&#39;m taking you. Y&#39;all. - [Milan] It&#39;s gonna be okay. - No, because I&#39;m
imagining like, okay, when Samia&#39;s 18 years old, you&#39;re gonna be taking her
to get her ears pierced, tattoos, this and that
without my permission? - No. - Right, so then I have to
call your mom and tell her. - No. - Why am I not ...
- Well, you can tell her. - So I can call
her and tell her? - Yeah, call her.
- Okay. Where&#39;s your mom? - The beauty supply store. - [Answering Machine]
Hi, it&#39;s Jillian ... - Oh, great. - I&#39;m surprised, you&#39;re really the only
one that she answers. If it were me calling, she
would have straight declined. (laughing) - That&#39;s so true. I&#39;m her number one. Sorry &#39;bout that. - [Milan] Wow. (answering phone) - Hello, Auntie Jillian. Auntie Jillian? - [Jillian] Yeah,
I&#39;m hearing you good. - Okay, you&#39;re
hearing me good, okay. We&#39;re at a tattoo
place, Milan and I. - [Jillian] Yeah, okay. - Okay, so, she&#39;s allowed to
get her ears pierced, right? - [Jillian] Yeah, if she
wants to get the second ones. - Okay, so cool, so then ... Okay, we&#39;re here. I just had to call and
confirm and make sure because she has me driving
her to get her ears pierced. I had to make sure that
you were okay with it and you knew about it. - [Jillian] Why
didn&#39;t she ask me? - Why? I don&#39;t know, maybe
I&#39;m cooler than you. - [Jillian] She said
she&#39;s waiting on LaToya and then now you take ... Well, she could have asked me. - To do what? - [Jillian] She said ... I said, &quot;Where are
you guys going?&quot; And she was just waiting on you, so she couldn&#39;t go get me. Tell her she&#39;s a liar and I
should tell her no she can&#39;t. (mumbles) - Okay, well,
you&#39;re a liar Milan. - How am I a liar mom? I wanted to surprise you. - Can she get her nose
pierced with me or no? - [Jillian] No. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right. Faruse is about to
pierce Milan&#39;s ear and then she&#39;s piercing mine. How do you feel about this? - I&#39;m excited. - [LaToya] You&#39;re excited? Why are you excited? - Because ... - [LaToya] This is exciting? - She sounds really
nervous here. - [LaToya] That is hilarious. You watch my videos. - I watch your videos,
and so does Ariel. - [LaToya] Who&#39;s Ariel? - My friend from school. You texted her. What&#39;d she say? - Yeah, I was like, &quot;Ariel, I&#39;m about to pierce
LaToya Forever&#39;s ears.&quot; But, she didn&#39;t reply. - [LaToya] Oh my gosh. I&#39;m so nervous, for Milan, because she hates needles. - She&#39;ll be fine. - [LaToya] Are you sure? - Yeah. - [LaToya] She&#39;s a big baby. - I&#39;m a freaking baby. - [LaToya] Oh my gosh. Are you a professional
ear piercer? - Yeah. - [LaToya] Okay. Did you go to school for this? - Nope. - [LaToya] Wait, what? How do you feel? - Whoo. I think I&#39;m gonna cry. - [LaToya] Are you sweating? - No, but I&#39;m scared. - [LaToya] Okay girl,
you&#39;re about to do it ... Yo, you have some
long hair girl. I love it.
- Thank you. - [LaToya] She pretty - Are you gonna count?
- [LaToya] She cute ,okay. - Yeah, I&#39;ll count for you. - [LaToya] What language
are you counting in? Hold on, I feel prepared. - One ... - You did it? - Two, three. - [LaToya] Yay,
that didn&#39;t hurt. Oh, it&#39;s so pretty. - Wow, I&#39;m so mad. I though it was gonna hurt more. - [LaToya] Milan, Milan ... - [Faruse] Did you
want it to hurt? - No, but then
you&#39;re like, &quot;One.&quot; And then you did it. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; - [LaToya] Now, one one ... Oh my gosh, okay let&#39;s go. - Oh, that one hurt a bit. - [LaToya] Oh, did it hurt? - Why does it hurt, why? Your left ear hurts more? - [Faruse] Yeah. - [LaToya] Wow. - It didn&#39;t hurt. Oh, I feel good. - [LaToya] It&#39;s so pretty. Oh my god, Milan. - Yeah. - [Faruse] Do you
want a lollipop? - [LaToya] Yes.
- Yes, give me a lollipop. (laughing) - Great sport. Okay, so now Faruse is gonna
try to poke my nose ring through my nose. Yeah, through my nose. I can get it half way through but I can&#39;t push it
all the way through. - [Faruse] You have
to pick a nose ring. - I have one. - Oh, okay. - Oh my god, oh my god. Wait, hold up, hold up. - Just tell me if it&#39;s hurting. - Mm-Hmm. - It&#39;s hurting?
- No. - You just have to wiggle
it around to find the hole. My eyes are watering. I&#39;m scared. - There&#39;s like a piece ... It went really far in. - Right.
- There&#39;s a piece of skin. Maybe just get it re-pierced. - Why can&#39;t you just poke
it through real quick? Is it gonna hurt? - Probably. You need something sharp
to poke it through. - Thank you though for trying. - No problem. - I&#39;m just gonna try to
poke it through myself. - [Milan] Oh my, uh-uh,
I don&#39;t wanna watch this. - That was (mumbles). I got it y&#39;all. I got it. Look. Oh, thank god it&#39;s through. It&#39;s through. - [Milan] Yay! - Yay! I was waiting for the
cheers and hand claps. (relaxed music) - What is good everyone? Just here at home
chilling by myself. LaToya is out. Something&#39;s been on my
mind for a while now. Not just today, it&#39;s been
on my mind for a while. I clearly see everything
that&#39;s been going on in the comments and it&#39;s just that certain
things just require time and ... You know what? Let me just turn the camera
and then let you guys know what I got here and we&#39;re literally just
about to talk about this so you guys are gonna
catch it all on camera. It&#39;s the other half of Rochelle. Andrew himself. How you been brother? - I been good man. How you been?
- [Adam] I&#39;m lovely. What up customers? Is that what you guys ... You still call them customers? - Yes.
- [Adam] That&#39;s what&#39;s up. - Customers. - [Adam] Okay, yeah,
so I was saying man, I&#39;ve been thinking
about just connecting. I mean, I&#39;ve connected
with you all the time. I ain&#39;t got no issue with you.
- We talk all the time. - [Adam] I see you at the gym,
we go out at the ball court a couple of times and he came out to my birthday. - Uh-Huh. - [Adam] It&#39;s been love ... - I was (mumbles) by the way. I enjoyed that. - [Adam] Oh, I&#39;m glad
y&#39;all had a good time. (club music) - A lot of times has passed,
it&#39;s been almost like, nine months. A child was born, Zayn was born during this
whole situation, right? - [Andrew] Yep. - Nothing heals more than time and I feel like we can create just the
line of communication between them to
figure it all out. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re
both humble enough to figure it out. - Pretty sure they
both miss each other. It&#39;ll just take a little
initiation just to make them have that communication
(mumbles) down time. We can go back to
having them out &#39;til four o&#39;clock in the morning and not coming home together
- [Adam] Oh my god. at each other&#39;s houses. - [Adam] You&#39;re
already planning that? That&#39;s gonna happen. I am not surprised
if that happens. - I&#39;m sure that they&#39;re
thinking about each other. When we do this they&#39;ll
be happy that we did this. - [Adam] Exactly. - I figured they
might do it themselves if we don&#39;t do it. - [Adam] Eventually. We&#39;ll think of a master
plan and make it happen. - Straight. - [Adam] Straight
up, let&#39;s get it. - Hey LaToya, I&#39;m so
excited for season ten. I can&#39;t wait to see you,
Adam, Samia and Zayn. - Hi, I&#39;m so excited. Please start season ten because
I love you so freaking much. You&#39;re my favorite YouTube. - I am so excited
for seasons ten. It&#39;s the only thing that
has been keeping me going and not going insane
this whole entire year. - [LaToya] So, Kadeem is
here, Milan&#39;s boyfriend. Oh, and he brought his friend. What&#39;s your name? - Paris&#39;s boy.
- Troy. - [LaToya] Oh,
Paris&#39;s boyfriend. - No. - [LaToya] Wait, so
are y&#39;all talking? - Yeah. - [LaToya] Aw, so what&#39;d
you like about her? - How do I (mumbles). - [LaToya] Okay,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, sorry, I&#39;m
putting you on the spot. My bad. I did not mean to do that. Anyways, Kadeem is
talkingish about how Milan&#39;s second hole in her
ear is too high. - Too high. - [LaToya] How is it too high? - Why is it too high? - Because she doesn&#39;t
have any in the rest so it just looks awkward. - [LaToya] Why are you
coming here talking ish to my cousin, yo? He&#39;s always talking shit. - He&#39;s so mad. Why are you mad? - [LaToya] Cool pants,
did you put bleach on it or did your mom spill
bleach on your pants? - [Milan] Exactly.
- I bought them like that. - [LaToya] Oh, okay, you
bought them like that. All right, that&#39;s the new swag? - And the holes like that. - [LaToya] Anyways ...
- Where&#39;s Jillian? - [LaToya] Why you asking
about Auntie Jillian? - Because I like (mumbles) - Just chill out. - I like her more than Milan. - [LaToya] Oh, okay. So, what do you
like about Milan? - There&#39;s too much
to go through. - [LaToya] Let&#39;s talk.
- Really? - [LaToya] There&#39;s too
much to go through? - Wow, (mumbles) why. He is so (mumbles). - I don&#39;t understand. Why when I ask a question
I can&#39;t get a straight forward answer, just an answer. What do you like about Kadeem? One thing and one thing only. - He&#39;s nice. - [LaToya] Okay, he&#39;s nice. I thought he was rude. - Not good enough for her. - She&#39;s annoying. - [LaToya] Oh, is that
what you like about her? - She&#39;s crazy and ... - [Milan] How am I crazy? If you think I&#39;m crazy,
you have not met LaToya. - Crazy? Yo, what is she ... - Wait, hold on, why are
you putting me in this? Me, LaToya?
- She hunch over like, &quot;Were you?&quot; Then if I don&#39;t
answer, she goes crazy and start ringing
down my throat. - [LaToya] Good, straight up. That&#39;s how you&#39;re
supposed to be. Boy, you&#39;re not texting me back? - I was in love with her. Then she gets all crazy. - [LaToya] It doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s how Trindi women are. Get used to it with
your Jamaican self. You didn&#39;t say what you like
about my freaking cousin and you&#39;re gonna
answer me right now. - She&#39;s cute and smart. - [LaToya] Okay, she&#39;s smart. I thought she got
Fs last semester. - Why are you exposing me? Why you gonna put me on blast? - [LaToya] Yeah, she is smart. Smart ass. But she real cute,
yeah she cute. All right y&#39;all, so
I&#39;m chilling in my bed with my beebee. Say hi beebs. - Hi. - I&#39;m waiting for Rochelle. Rochelle is coming over. We&#39;re gonna talk about
- Hi. our issues. - Hi, hi. - You know, we have
a lot to talk about. - Hi, hi, hi, hi. - Can you say hi? - Yeah (mumbles) - We&#39;re just gonna lay all of
our issues out on the table and just express how we feel. My issue is, I have no filter. That can be hurtful sometimes. Whenever Rochelle has an
issue, she does not express how she feels and it makes it seem like
she doesn&#39;t care. Rochelle and I, we go way back. We know each other. We just have a lot of pride and it sucks that
it took so long for us to connect and meet up. Better late than never. It&#39;s so cute how Andrew
and Adam got together, trying to bring us together. Shout outs to them for trying
to save our friendship. I always knew that Rochelle
and I would come back together and be best friends again. I just want to get everything
out and in the open. I just want to get
everything off of my chest and just see what
happens moving forward with our relationship. What should mommy
say to Rochelle? - Sorry. (laughing) - [LaToya] She gonna say sorry? - Yeah. - [LaToya] Okay. (lively music) - Rochelle is here. Say hi Rochelle. - Hi, hunties. - [LaToya] And huncles. - And huncles. - We missed you
- And in between. Anyways, Rochelle and
I, we talked about ... - Say hi. - Hi. - You have pudding
all over your face. Did you say hi to Auntie Roti? Auntie Roti. - [Samia] Hi Auntie Roti. - Rochelle and I had a
little talk off camera and we&#39;re cool now. We&#39;re friends. It took us over seven months
to acknowledge each other, say anything, bring it up. - Unnecessarily. - Unnecessarily. This didn&#39;t have to happen,
but Rochelle and I both have so much pride. We are strong personalities. We are like the same person. - [Rochelle] We
are very similar, but we&#39;re also very different. - Right. When I get upset I&#39;m ...
- [Rochelle] Unfiltered. I say stupid things. - [Rochelle] Just unfiltered. - Unfiltered.
- [Rochelle] You say the first thing that
comes to your mind. - The first thing
that comes to my mind. What the heck? Why do I do this? It&#39;s something that
I have to work on. - Mommy. - Rochelle doesn&#39;t
like confrontation. - If anyone does
anything to bother me, I&#39;m not the type of
person to confront it and be like, &quot;Hey, can I
talk to you about something that you said earlier that
made me feel uncomfortable?&quot; - Yeah. - I absolutely never do that. - You just ignore it. What do you do? You just ... She doesn&#39;t say anything. - I do ignore it. I&#39;m very passive. - So what am I? - You&#39;re aggressive. (laughing) - I also feel like being
on You Tube itself, played a role in
this whole thing too. - Oh, for sure. - Obviously now of this would
have mattered or happened or even been about if it
weren&#39;t for the fact that we&#39;re both YouTube
personalities. - The entire falling
out happened online. - Yeah, right. People say, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m
one of those people who, I feel like
comments don&#39;t get to me and comments don&#39;t bother
me, blah, blah, blah.&quot; Who cares what they say, right? Somehow in the back of
your mind, somewhere, you are conscience of
a whole bunch of people thinking something
about you, right? - Right, exactly.
- (mumbles) things in you that you didn&#39;t even notice. - [LaToya] Right. - People keep pointing it out. - You start to question it. - I&#39;m like, &quot;What?&quot; - Yeah, really. - No, wow. - People would always say,
&quot;Oh LaToya, you&#39;re fat, you&#39;re fat, you&#39;re fat. You&#39;re gaining weight. You&#39;re pregnant. You&#39;re fat.&quot; I would question that. I&#39;m like, &quot;Yo, am I fat? Am I gaining weight?&quot; Did I gain weight
though Rochelle? - No.
- Oh okay. Am I losing weight? - You&#39;re smaller than me. - Okay, yeah you gained a
little bit of weight, girl. - I did, I did. - Yeah, okay, but
you still look good. - I&#39;m okay with that though. I&#39;m okay, you know
what I&#39;m saying? I&#39;m a grown woman,
but I&#39;m gonna diet. Obviously being on social
media played a part in our situation as well. - Yeah. - Yeah, it&#39;s one of
those live and you learn type of situations. - Make sure that this
doesn&#39;t happen again. It took us over seven months. - Right. - I&#39;m sorry. - I&#39;m sorry. - All right. - So ... (laughing) - This is so stupid. - Yeah. - But yeah, I missed my friend. - Yeah, it was very weird. - Mm-Hmm.
- To be on the outside of your life, I guess. - I know. Would you, like, creep me? - I would creep you. I would watch your vlogs. (laughing) I am creeping. I was just checking to see ...
- I would be up on your Instagram ... - ... When it happened. Just to see if
everything was all right. This doesn&#39;t have
to happen again. - No. - Obviously it&#39;s
important to be vocal. - Yeah. If you have issues
moving forward can we just address it?
- It&#39;s also important to not be too vocal. - Can we address it? - No, don&#39;t touch me, but yeah. I have a cold. - Yeah you do. I don&#39;t even know why you&#39;re
on my couch right now. - We both need to adapt a
little bit of each other&#39;s personalities, right? - Why? - I need to be more verbal and
you need to be less verbal. - Okay. (laughing) So, yes, Rochelle
and I are friends. - Like we never left. - You will be
seeing her, I hope. Right? - Yes.
- More often. I&#39;m just so happy I don&#39;t even
know what to say right now. I just feel like
my true self again. - Me too. I missed you very much. - I missed you too. Can I have a hug? - Only have (mumbles)
- No? Okay, fine. (laughing) Now you have too. Give me your hug, I&#39;m waiting. - Oh, god. - This is what we need in
our relationship, more love, and affection. Let me see. Hug me. Put your ... Oh my gosh, isn&#39;t this so cute? - Can I go now? (laughing) - Give Auntie Roti a hug. - I don&#39;t wanna get her sick. - Hey what&#39;s up everyone? About to head to bed. LaToya&#39;s upstairs,
she just got in. She had a smile on her face. I think she met
up with Rochelle. I&#39;m gonna go figure
out how it went. Hey, what&#39;s good? - What&#39;s up? I&#39;m tired. Come to bed. - [Adam] I am in bed. - No you&#39;re not. Get in. - [Adam] How&#39;d it go? - Everything&#39;s good. She came over. We had a conversation
just about our ... Hold on, let me tell
you guys something. While me and Andrew are
talking about having the girls connect, let me find out that
they&#39;ve actually had started a conversation
from a few days ago anyway, which proves the theory that men need to stay in their lane. That&#39;s just what it is. This is what happens when
you get in girls&#39; business. A lesson learned. - Not really. It was a kind gesture. Say, if we didn&#39;t connect, would our friendship be saved? - Listen, men, stay
in your lane man. Don&#39;t get into any girl talk. This is what happens. You get proved wrong. - Oh please. - [Adam] Should
have stayed in ... - Thanks for trying. - [Adam] Should have
stayed on my ass. Should have stayed on my ass. Oh my god. So yeah, everything wet well. Listen, people fight,
people argue, dispute, miscommunication. - It&#39;s a part of being human. Yeah, I just felt like ... I think Rochelle sad
something on social media that LaToya didn&#39;t find too fun and they just never
really talked about it. - [LaToya] Yeah. - And then, you
know, I guess ... - I was pregnant and you know when I&#39;m pregnant
I&#39;m crazy as hell. - I can&#39;t really
tell the difference between when LaToya
is pregnant or not. I really can&#39;t. It is what it is. - [LaToya] I&#39;m crazy
no matter what? - I can&#39;t really take it
when she says I&#39;m pregnant and she does certain things. I&#39;m like, &quot;You would have
probably done that anyway.&quot; If you want to use that
card, sure, take it. - [LaToya] Yes,
I&#39;m pregnant y&#39;all. I was, well, I&#39;m not pregnant. I was pregnant. - Yes, please make sure
you tell people that you were pregnant. - [LaToya] There&#39;s
no where to go. - There&#39;s no kids. Yeah, hopefully
everything goes good. We&#39;re human. - We&#39;ll just see what
happens moving forward but of course that&#39;s
how Rochelle and I are. We&#39;re gonna be bff tomorrow. We were always bff, but, we
just had a misunderstanding. Rochelle and I are
the type of people, we have a lot of pride and so, we&#39;re back together and
everything is peachy, peachy supreme. - All right guys, so I&#39;m
moving out actually, already, since Rochelle&#39;s
back in our lives. I&#39;m just joking. We&#39;re going to
New York tomorrow. We&#39;re getting ready for it. - [LaToya] I&#39;m so shocked that you&#39;re packing
for New York right now. I&#39;m shocked. - Everyone falls
in love sometimes. - [LaToya] He&#39;s so last minute. - Anyways guys, hope you enjoyed
