To understand more about the unknown called the paranormal Helping people who are experiencing the... The unknown called the paranormal And I made a very special request You, really don&#39;t want to miss Make sure you activate the subtitles If you see the subtitles right now? That means it is activated Otherwise click the CC-icon in the bottom right corner of the player Because I&#39;m going to perform this interview in Dutch I always watched Hollywood ghost movies when I was little The unexplainable fascinates me until today I think most of my viewers the spiritual and the paranormal really appeals to them Because it&#39;s an area of the unexplainable People stay with hundreds of questions behind after an experience In the broadcast a woman from Netherlands Who saw as a little girl apparitions And helps people with her gift The unknown is her field, her job Once appeared in a handful of magazines Once took part in the RTL show &#39;The Sixth Sense&#39; I do not need to be gifted that this is about a very beautiful appearance Psychic, medium, I&#39;m talking about the one and only Annemarie Smit Welcome to the broadcast Annemarie Hello
- Have you seen any old grannies lately? No, not today I look forward to your questions Be patient We had last week a very long fun conversation You mentioned you saw an old granny standing behind me Very nice, me in a dark studio A granny behind me, nice! Top, Super I have been sleeping with the lights on You did a great job on that Annemarie - You are welcome Yes, you are very good doing that I&#39;m going with you into a deep conversation About the paranormal I will also include a question from a viewer Most did not put question mark behind it. These are not questions but personal experiences That&#39;s very interesting
- ok, yes Something else Annemarie, my head will do this It&#39;s not that I have Parkinson But because I am recording from a separate camera Ok, yes very clear
- Si, very good! My followers on Youtube are mainly Americans They want you in the broadcast. After seeing the video &quot;I am communicating with the dead&quot; In fact, 100% of all my viewers wants you Annemarie. What does that mean to you? Firstly I have to say I feel very honored I am happy that I&#39;m allowed to do this. I feel honored to be part of this interview Yes, I&#39;m excited This also tells us that they are open to the paranormal
- Yes I think the Dutch (sorry Dutch viewers) are less open to the paranormal than Americans Is that right? Yes, you see that in TV programs in the Netherlands How people in America see psychics and mediums They are much more open to the paranormal Here they are, just do normal Then you&#39;re doing crazy enough
- Yes, exactly They open for the paranormal gradually, but it&#39;s not like in America In England it&#39;s also very on the rise And more tolerated than in the Netherlands Will it ever be okay with the Dutch? Yes I think so. But then we will be in elderly center when that happens We must keep our hope After 10 years, people can no longer ignore We are becoming more aware. We always listen more to our feelings You live in a very small village right? - I live in a village yes (laughter)
And how do the people respond &quot;FREAK&quot; Yeah, little bit of &quot;Freak&quot; However, it&#39;s way better compared with 10 years ago People from my village are slowly reaching out to me In general, I get people from across the country except this village They are coming from the west, north, south This is not a typical religious village, but uhm, maybe you know the village Staphorst? Staphorst, yes of course. Never been there but i&#39;ve heard of it. Yes exactly, i&#39;ve never been there too. But that&#39;s a very religious town How does the religious people react? Because they are a bit extremer Do they see this as bad? Do they think you&#39;re talking with devils? Yes, then you are the devil Yes, if I am allowed to tell you this I also give lessons as you apparently know I had someone ever in my lesson Who thought that I was the Devil The person had read that somewhere and just left my lesson That&#39;s the problem with people. I notice under my content. People read things They accept the information with performing research They are running around like a headless chicken Yes, when you claim things Or if you read things. Don&#39;t accept them as the truth. Perform research, it&#39;s very logic. Maybe not for them The only thing they believe .... I need to click some things away You have to many viruses, but that&#39;s ok Do you still hear me?
- Yes Yes Yes Very annoying those viruses?
- Yes very annoying However, they believe in one religion and that&#39;s all fine for them I don&#39;t feel attacked because of that. That&#39;s their choice It&#39;s a bit weird, they believe in Angels, Devils and Heaven But they don&#39;t believe in that or they believe it but label it as Devils Basically biased Yes, well, I don&#39;t know everything in the Bible. I think you should leave the dead in peace Not that I am sure about but just a perspective The contact with the dead goes through the Devil But I&#39;m not sure about that But, you also have cases that the dead is reaching out to you, the opposite Yes, they are very happy the dead can reach out Each remain their character
- Yes One is more reclusive, one is more open He or she will also manifest like that If I&#39;m going to tell you about your grandfather and he was a modest person and he comes suddenly as enthusiastic forward And I tell you that he&#39;s very enthusiastic and has a lot of energy, you would not recognize him I recognize this because me too have lived in a village and My experience, if you&#39;re going to live in a village as the only colored man Village in province Sea Land Christian as hell Every Wednesday and Sunday to church &quot;I do not&quot; but those people do A good time was needed to be accepted and to be shaped It is a particular bias what they have, you are being labeled Remain yourself that you&#39;ve probably done too. Time heals all wounds You were in the Dutch TV show of NPO, called &quot;Jan Drive Around&quot; You&#39;ve got your deserved attention You said you saw faces when you were a little Annemarie If you say something like that, I think of faces right in front of me During our acquaintance you have corrected me Explain my viewers how exactly you see these things I must mention, in my youth I saw them visually With my earthly eyes. You understand what I&#39;m saying?
- Yes And also with my 3rd eye You understand what I&#39;m talking about That is how you see things and how psychics are seeing things I saw them very clearly like if I see thing normally Especially in the night If you&#39;re in a different state of consciousness For example, if you are in bed The phase between sleep and wakefulness, you know
- Yes Then you see them often with the 3rd eye. But then it looks like you really see them with your normal eyes You understand what I am saying? The people who have been experiencing this Understand what I mean. Probably many viewers recognize this that they see more things at night than during day Because they&#39;re in a different state of consciousness And when it&#39;s dark you can see more When it&#39;s dark, I knock my head against walls and cabinets Ok that&#39;s very clear ... I mean I will be clear. If it is dark you can see more energy You see orbs or  light bulbs You see movements in the dark, you will see shadows Always verify, if they are earthly things But the light bulbs or orbs, than you know already what&#39;s going on. Or if you see apparitions Are of course not earthly It can look so real, as if a burglar is standing beside your bed That doesn&#39;t scare you? That depends. I can only speak based on my own experiences And of course the experiences of people I spoke with I will tell you my experience One moment Mostly you are not afraid at night because you feel calm You look... you&#39;re more an observer of what you see Fear is not present at the moment if you  see things It&#39;s more curiosity &quot;Hey, who do I see there&quot; And &quot;What do I see there&quot; You are going to focus on your eyes. The image remains Gradually, it is becoming increasingly blurred, and then it&#39;s gone Now, when I do consulting And make contact with the deceased one I see them in my head People think, you&#39;re out of your head. You must go to the madhouse because you see people in your head These are about people and I they describe their character how they will recognize them How they were deceased and their hobbies You mentioned the third eye, it&#39;s something everyone has Don&#39;t have the idea That the media, food and drinks are polluting the Pineal gland (3rd eye) It is eliminated on purpose? Do believe that? That is why people are not in touch with their third eye? I believe that My intuition is telling that I believe in English they say Pineal gland
- Yes That may indeed become polluted I believe it can. For example, you can not eat meat If you want to keep it free of pollution Yes, I truly believe so I have not studied it yet. I believe that it is indeed possible What I also believe and has to do with it a little bit There is noise in our line I mean Noise in our energy caused by stress, work, people just by everything By life and you carry that energy. Because of that you can get polluted I know you can stimulate or activate your third eye by eating particular food For example by eating pineapple
- Oh yes, PINEAPPLE PINEAPPLE. So you now know what you have to eat a lot of pineapples I will delve into it How do you communicate with, I simply say them? Actually pure intention It goes basically just naturally. Simply pure power of thought Just transfer of thoughts You just receive Thoughts. Souls or spirits who transfers their answers or questions to you, in your mind Yes. Yes you can be clairsentience, clairvoyant , clairaudient, clairolfaction or clairsentience It is the combination of certain senses you have If you hear someone is talking in your head Those are your own thoughts. It comes at once. It&#39;s just there. The transfer is in a split second You can feel certain things like if this person had a heavy voice Or stuttered It&#39;s just a combination of everything where you good at it One is more clairsentient, the other is more clairvoyant Some the combination of several things It&#39;s in your head The words, the phrases or thoughts In addition, I would add that You can go with your focus to the spiritual world You can put yourself in the power I will explain briefly. You can put yourself in the power, you increase your own light You make it bigger and bigger You can make it as big as your room or outside your room or the universe What do you like best Then, you go with your attention to the spiritual world You ask them to come closer And to come into your energy, blending with your energy This is in short explained how you can make contact So, you ask them to come closer Then, there is someone standing ... anyone at that moment When people come here to consult they are already here They already know that this person is going to come on consultation It&#39;s out of my power, if the person they want to speak is actually present Or first comes another person. Then this other person Because this can be more evidence for the ones We do not always control to decide Going back to your childhood I know that there are young people who experience this too When you were young Didn&#39;t you had a moment &quot;This is a fantasy.&quot; How did you deal with this? As a child I was always afraid I have to say Because I&#39;m in the bedroom, in the hallway what you mentioned with the faces In my bedroom I always saw shadows and energies The craziest energies actually This was so real How I dealt with it? Well, not. I was just scared Back than we had no internet to search for information Like, I see this and that, what is that? I also did not had the need to discuss this with my parents You never had talked with your parents about this? Not when I was a child, no
- Oh You&#39;ve suppressed it
- Sorry? Yes, I should not have done that. That happens. My aunt was familiar with this I could tell her. But yeah I was more of a private person. Did not talk about my feelings Never mind, you know. Forget it I&#39;m afraid. It&#39;s there I was just afraid of the dark I always wanted a light on - Lights on?
Yes, because I always saw things in the dark Ok, well you&#39;re not the only one NO?
- No No No No I always slept with a cowboy hat. I was fan of Lucky Luck back than With lights on Not truly a definition of a heroic cowboy No.
- No No No No How did you distinguish between fantasy and paranormal when you were young? What was your ultimate proof Of ... this is not a fantasy, It&#39;s real, I&#39;m not crazy Those faces were clear to me. Who were clearly physically That was just obvious. They were just there So what I said. They were more floating faces I just saw them in the hallway That was convincing for me I knew there was always more but I always denied it In my puberty, I saw light bulbs, i saw energy, I saw people standing next to my bed That to me was very clear I knew I was not crazy, I don&#39;t people I was seeing things. But I knew I was not crazy The more spiritual books, we used books before the Internet came The more spiritual books I read, the more I myself opened the spiritual The more paranormal experiences Funny, probably your parents knew what was going on Because if you only read spiritual books they will think &quot;What is my child up to?&quot; Apparently yes, yes, my brother had the same so he owned also these kind of books So, I read his books too Correction: &quot;What is my children up to?&quot;
- Yes exactly I think they thought: &quot;Let it be&quot; With all due respect. Not to insult them or anything, but they were also busy They had their own business Too busy with other things that they don&#39;t see other things anymore What advice can you give young people? You managed to suppress this Something you should not do, right? Yes, something you should not do What advice can you give young people who experience such things not necessary exactly like what you have experienced But other paranormal experiences. What advice do you have for them? First of all Be yourself The basis is ... I do not know if I can keep it short... I will try The basis is actually create as much peace But realize that everything is energy The moment they realize and have the consciousness that everything is energy Then they can play with it To have control over whether they want to see those things yes or no Suppose one of the viewers, child or parents with a child who see dead people Ask your child what they see, what they feel How does it feel? Does it feel uneasy Or it feels just positive and Let that child simply explain it Should the children go to the doctor? Good question
- Because doctors do tend to give medication Yes, I find it difficult to give my opinion about that Oh, we do have a pill for it. Take it in. Three times a day. Yes exactly, just ritalin here you go Then you walk around like this every day Then you lose your ability
- Yes exactly, so... If it is very serious. Indeed, go to the doctor. Which is important, but ... Look closely at the child. Interrogate with the child, go to ... a medium where you feel positive about as parent I&#39;m not sure that children also look at your program
- Yes You&#39;re dealing with everybody, in all kinds Then they can just keep the energy to themselves. You can just make the energy small, that&#39;s just a tip Be aware that you can make the energy big such as your aura and your light Don&#39;t you want to see anything, you just say, &quot;Guys, I am not in the mood right now&quot; &quot;Leave me alone, I just want to focus on myself&quot; They need to know that they are in control They are the boss What is also very important. It&#39;s more of a practical tip... Your breathing, think of your breathing
- Meditation Meditation too, breathing , Then you can do meditation
- Ammmmmmm Controlling your breath is very important. What you can do... I will explain it briefly count 4 seconds through your nose, counting 4 to 8 out through your nose. You close your eyes otherwise you become distracted Go with your focus to your stomach People with smokers lungs may shorten the counts I will faint, you know that. Then you do the count of two, four counts out No just kidding Like having a hyperventilation
- Yes, exactly Then you count out 4 to 6 seconds, also good Also important Count in your head... yes, 1... 2... 3... 4 Than 4-8 out Because you are distracting your mind You will find that you become more peaceful in your head You also seems to be more peaceful If you have your breathing under control, then you have your mind and body under control too You said that so wonderful
- Oh yeah, it is so People will experience it when they are going to do that At that moment you ground yourself You can also do grounding meditation You go with your focus to your feet, from your feet come roots. The roots go deep into the Earth. Your feet are like two trees That&#39;s how you root them down to give you an example Do you feel tingling under your feet and toes And you can do a very fun test, for young and old If you have not done the grounding exercise Let someone lift you up Then that person can lift you Then you do the breathing exercise. Fully focused you going to do the breathing exercise Then you go with your focus to your feet Imagine it, feel it, visualize it Keep that focus and say, &quot;Try to lift me again&quot; You will see that this person can&#39;t lift you or can&#39;t lift you up that easily anymore So if you have your focus on your feet, as I said briefly Then you&#39;re literally stuck - OK
A really nice little test to do Back to your question, what you can actually advise youngsters The basis is actually the breathing Take good care of yourself Make sure you are in your energy Get enough rest Do not worry if you take your rest that you will be labeled as lazy As a sensitive person, you need your rest And indicate your borders Interesting, you claim Imagine, we are standing in front of each other I ask you; &quot;Hey, I have a challenge for you&quot; &quot;Lift me up&quot; You say: &quot;Yes, well, super, let&#39;s do it.&quot; I am thinking, &quot;My feet are chained to the ground&quot; You have a lot of problems to lift me up Is it &quot;A&quot; caused by my body weight? B B, You do not have much arm strength C, Because you exerts mentally on the tangible world And now D Yes
- Uhh Yes, Annemarie has also humor It&#39;s C, You need someone who can lift you up You have to test. You have to test in advance And lift that person up who&#39;s going to do that exercise Then, that person is going to do that exercise, yes... Focus, Focus, Focus, intention, intention, than focus on your feet Make a story, imagine big trees Or two big magnets fixed on the Earth As long as it is rooted in the ground Then remain that focus Also at the moment that person is trying to lift you up Stay focused, focus, focus Make a gesture for &quot;Ok, lift me up&quot; And stay focused on your feet And than Is it not your arm strength Then that person can not lift you up It takes practice, so do not give up if you think &quot;it is not working&quot; Stay focused, the power of the mind, you know that Where your focus goes, there goes your energy too Whatever you want, that happen This is positive as well as negative It&#39;s better to be as far as possible in positive mindset than negative Briefly Focus on your feet with this exercise So if you ever come to Marbella, I will lift you up Yeah, first you lift me up I&#39;m going to do my funny exercise My tree exercise Yes, you will hold the trees Yes, exactly Than you are not able to lift me up. If i&#39;m correct
- OK Very good Now something serious On your 20th year you went through a gray period You lost a very good friend Did you get ever in touch with him?
- Yes And was that some kind of eye-opener? &quot;I have to do something with it&quot; Yes, correct Many thing crossed my path, such as the lost of my best friend After his death Clearly .... in my dreams Deceased also come in our dreams After that I had a lot of prophetic dreams This trauma a.k.a. event had Opened things in me You understand? A lot of people has this If something happen you will think about life, you think why Then, if it&#39;s your path Than a spiritual path will be opened In this case too. So I find help at a psychic She said: &quot;You can do the same work what I do&quot; Very nice, but I can do little with that information It was of course a confirmation but I had no tools of &quot;how I&#39;m going to do this&quot; How am i going to deal with this Later on I brought a visit to someone who explained a lot About how to ground yourself, how to take care of your own energy etc Short afterwards That opened a lot inside of me and I saw him afterwards very often in my dreams I also saw his energy when I was in bed or sofa And on this way I talked with him You can explain it way better than I do, what is the dead? - What is the dead?
Death is more a transformation What we explain here on earth, than there will be nothing The death is a change, a transformation or resurrection It is just a change, that&#39;s all it is Change of what? Change of energy, change of consciousness OK, why are they here? You mean why the deceased here? Among other things, to help us Some are here to help us or their... Loved one they left behind, some have clearly tasks To help them, support them in curtain phases of their life That&#39;s why they are with us But that&#39;s not always the case I also experience souls who are busy here with their thing And find it difficult Some find it difficult to let go some earthly things They still continue but they sometimes are struggling Some are accomplishing their goals People(here) who travel a lot, to give you an example... Are traveling there too It is not always the case if your granny, just as example
- Ah my granny again For example your granny loves to travel She love to go to places That was her mission, that was her path She will not, well I can&#39;t decide for her The granny can choice to travel there too I can imagine that too. You are free, you can go where ever you want... Wiiiiiiiiiiiii
- Yes, yoehoe What will you do if you are dead? Will you do bad things? I will peek I think a lot people will do that
- I think so too I think 100% of all my viewers will piek &quot;kiekaboeee&quot; Yes, exactly, What shall I do when I&#39;m dead? I think I want to help the people I left behind I always want to help people so I think I will do that I prefer not to be passive We have talked about this during our acquaintance I love to be active I will address everything, I want to learn things, I want to .... You are right about that you can&#39;t sit still, You wobble on your chair Do I wobble?
- No, I am fooling around I shall guide my children Helping the people I left behind Does your children know about you? Yes, my oldest child. That child is 9 year-old and knows it It&#39;s very normal to him
- Sober, they find it very normal I think you do a good thing, it&#39;s not unknown for them Yes correct, They need to find their own vision, so to speak My daughter, the youngest, she&#39;s 3.5 years-old Yeah, a bit to young for this
- Yes But
- Yes, but The younger you are, the more you are open to the paranormal Yes mostly they are Yes true What&#39;s your scariest or most impressive experience ever? Yes, that I....
- I have to say something People don&#39;t know this, but before we start the recordings I told her The batteries running empty, I do not know why Now again, the battery was full. Now it&#39;s suddenly empty. Never had this problem We keep recording if my camera shuts off, not the camera I am talking with you But the main camera, we continue the interview We won&#39;t let it resist us
- No, ok This is really bizarre Bizarre, I never experienced this. I make sure I don&#39;t have lazy batteries I let the battery drain well Fully recharging and they are new batteries And it behaves like this, I normally can record 3 hours in a row. But not now Very flabbergasting, this has to do something with you Yeah you never know. I don&#39;t believe in coincidence It has its reason But you can&#39;t escape my question, What&#39;s your scariest or most impressive experience ever? I need to dig memories now That someone was standing next to my bed and I thought it was a burglar What? Recently?
- No, that happened a few years ago I was dreaming, I mean, I was half awake I woke up And I saw very clearly that someone was standing next to my bed In addition it felt peaceful, in this case it felt not that great I was really shocked by that I really shouted &quot;HELP&quot; out loud
- Negative That was really scary because it was physically very present This reminds me of documentaries at Discovery Think about the sleep paralysis thing When they call the name of Jesus it stops There was a boy who experienced Sleep Paralysis his entire youth A paranormal investigation team were there, took EVP and indeed heard things They discovered indeed something strange what didn&#39;t belong there The boy even stayed at the church Even that didn&#39;t worked When he called the name Jesus it stopped I&#39;m not a religious type of person and I don&#39;t want to promote it either in this video But I really want to mention it So if people are experiencing that, scary crook next to your bed you can call out for Jesus, maybe Have you ever heard of that?
- Sorry what? Have you ever heard of that, when you call that name it stop? Well, I am doing that sometimes. I can tell you a lot What I often do, I advice people to do the same In my workshops and private consults Who those things or are very sensitive What you can do, and I am not that religious But I ask Jesus for help Jesus is not directly linked to religion But, basically he&#39;s independent from that I have to confess, that I asked him for help lately Nothing ventured, nothing gained So, yes I truly believe in that I ask my guide, the angels always for help in the evening To protect us at every windows and doors that night To give use a peaceful night
- Very interesting The next question what I want to know from you, Oh you already knew that, Are Angels and Devils real, have you ever been in contact with them? I read that often in my comments when I talk about the paranormal, but do they exist? Devils, Angels yes. That&#39;s how I see it, that&#39;s my truth You claim they exist? Yes or no
- Yes You ever been in contact with them? With the the lower energies, let me label them that way, yes The angels, yes, I ask them each day for help And for protection and for power And if they want to help me and some people with their mission So, yes The energy of an angel in contrast with a guide Feels always different People can always experience it if they want What you can do is, to indicate to the spiritual world I want to feel the difference between my guide and an angel I want my main guide to come forth and feel how it feels Now ask to take distance and request an Angel, you can even request a name of an angel You can ask for angel uriel or angel Michael And ask, I like to want to feel your energy. How does that feel? Because I want to feel the difference and also experience the energy It is important that you know where feelings or thoughts are coming from Understand? The low energy, yes, I do believe in evil energy It depends where you are focusing on Can you, at the request come in contact with any deceased? I can upon request yes. But as mentioned earlier, I can not promise that the person will be there If people request it is 8 out of 10 times yes Interesting, please continue Yes I can at the request, but it&#39;s always wait and see how the contact goes One will be stronger than the other, but to answer your question. Yes, I can get in touch at the request with the deceased Lions Ground nothing goes too far. I see an immediate link Nobody does this, nobody on the Internet as far as I know Would you like to work on a project to unravel the secrets of NASA, I mean Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell lost his life on his 85th year and... Could you come in contact with Edgar, I mean ... Most people agree that NASA and the Government has secrets concerning Extraterrestrial Life There are officials that they are even here, and that there is contact What&#39;s on the moon what we may not know and There are so many things which you could unravel Would you like to to work on this with Lions Ground Yes, but I want to think about it
- Sure Discussing how and what It was just an idea because we are talking. I make immediate links It&#39;s a secret that does not come out through the official way. Occasionally they release now and than a document, The FBI and CIA, etc, but ... People are not stupid and know that there is more going on I know that in the Netherlands psychics are used to solve murder cases Why not this? Yes that&#39;s right, why not. You say that this has never been done? -No, No I am going to think about it
- Yes There are 90,000 CIA documents released on telepathy, clairvoyance and MKULTRA You heard ever of MKULTRA?
- No. That&#39;s a mind control program, which are released 90,000 secret documents have been released about that What did they do, they have used a group of people with your gift To experiment What can the CIA do with your gift? Good one! Tjee They can feel into on organizations, companies Feeling into why Feeling into and look at specific people in the story Yes Images that come through because is not always a coherent story If I talk about murders the story comes in flashes As a medium we have to make a structured story out of it Sometimes it&#39;s not possible to make a  story, as outsider we put the puzzle pieces together What can we do more for the CIA, let me think I believe that you can influence things You can affect the energy. Purely with the intention, pure with the power of the mind What can you do more for the CIA No idea, but that what I just said Interesting, so they can access thoughts, the environment, but also carry out influence Do you think the CIA is still doing this? You&#39;re asking me very dangerous questions Could quite be possible, right?
- Yes could be possible, let me tell you that I have a question from a viewer What is the name? LotDoVahbron, a very special name It was more about palmistry. Palmistry or not, I do not care Do You Need a picture? Would you like to do a reading and how do you get such information? No, I do not need a photo. A name is enough A photo is useful if a name is not working I do telephone consultation, we also exchange just a name So no, a photo is not required Would you want to read that person and how you get the info has become clear in this interview Yes I want to help that person
- That person can just contact you right? Yes indeed, I have a website ...
- Annemarie-paragnost.nl The person can mail me and contact me Then we can schedule a session Your website Annemarie-paragnost.nl Is also available in English, right? Yes, but the English version is off There will come an English version very soon The English version is taken off because of old information My website is very old I paid no attention to the English version because I could not do anything with it I&#39;m not handy with websites, it&#39;s not my focus By coincidence, I stopped the English version You go do something with your gifts do or are you going to stop?
- No, I&#39;m going to just do something with it I&#39;m busy writing workshops and i&#39;m doing already workshops I&#39;m working on writing workshops to follow up people with guide contact Or to bring people closer to their feelings Meditation workshops And to record meditation, I&#39;m still working on it On CD or what ever And next year, along with my colleague, I&#39;m realizing a training I combine mediumship and he will do numerology Yes, you were doing that during our meeting You saw all kinds of simple numbers But that&#39;s not my department. My department is mediumship and psychic Therefore, your website is very important to focus on. I mean... It is the only way to get in touch with people from abroad I suppose, because your website is also in English or was that you work on international nivea, right? Yes of course, we are also going to realize an English version Also the meditations We are going (I do not know if I may say this) to teach at Zwanenhof And we want to do this also in English You can say everything here on Lions Ground. We are straight to the point You can swear, you can say &quot;cunt&quot; No problem Great, I will do that! What I want to know from you, have you ever had an overseas request? What was that about? And which country? Not Belgium, do not choose Belgium 
- What do you say? No, not Belgium Happens to be actually Belgium
- Oh no Also, many from Belgium. As you know, I work over the phone I also do telephone consultation. And people from Belgium can call that number Do you talk with Belgian accent? &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Annemarie &#39; Oh no, with all due respect to the Belgians Ok, yeah yeah
- Yes Yes, he says Yes Yes So you work internationally, I will add a link to your website in the video description Annemarie-paragnost.nl I have diligently browsed through your website, I received many viruses (Just kidding) There was information in English, they can always visit your site Is there something you want to say? This is your moment Now that you have about it, I can always respond in English You speak English?
- Yes My English is very good (poor English)
- My English is very very good I also have an accent, do not worry About children or juveniles, it&#39;s very important, I don&#39;t know how it is in America Here in the Netherlands, they need a lot of guidance And desire, but they do not know where they should go The people who look at this video, young people or parents of young people can contact me I explain things on a very earthly way I will make sure there is enough info. Annemarie, thank you very much for the great answers I hope it has become clearer for people My golden question is, we will see you again at Lions Ground Annemarie? If many people want, I am willing to do another nice interview with you After the recording, she says, &quot;I never want to be on Lions Ground&quot; Okay, that&#39;s your prediction Yes I can see that Wow you learn very quickly What people do not know what I&#39;ve told you earlier That I want to create a win-win situation Because you do such a good job Because young people have nowhere to go because of the lack of information In fact, too much information, that you grab the wrong information They need to know that it&#39;s actually not that difficult They have to do any elaborate rituals
- Less is more Less is more indeed They need to know they should not do very difficult things such as rituals No, it&#39;s very simple You don&#39;t have to slaughter chickens and drink their blood No, you just to hang them Ok that is the working style of Annemarie, she hangs the chickens Yes it is very simple, you are in control Sounds like a good idea to have contact once a month Update: Whatever you do, new information, new site or new collaboration I wish you the best and I wish people the same who want to know more about this And I find it very interesting I also have experienced unexplainable things Then you know personally, there&#39;s more I have not been investigating to find out what is it and why For example sleep paralysis That for me was a terrifying experience I&#39;m not afraid, but it was scary When I had experienced that, I stood up in bed, looked in the mirror and said &quot;I never want to experience this again&quot; Ok, you have also experienced that When I lived in the city Bergen op Zoom ... Now I am talking about it, let&#39;s tell the entire story I had a bad relationship I was alone It was 5-6 AM I went to bed, I&#39;m a night owl You are kidding me?
- What? No kidding sorry, you said &quot;I&#39;m a night owl&quot;
- Yes Are not you a night owl? No, I&#39;m not a night person I have children who get out of bed early
- Hmmm, pity So it&#39;s 5-6 AM, I go to bed, the birds are chirping, which I really hate Annemarie I hate singing birds, especially in the morning It became light. Left to me was standing a white wall I always sleep with a pillow and blankets over my head I was awake, no, I woke up I could not move. I saw a shadow of the ceiling hovering slowly towards me I felt the pillow and the blanket were being moved And a female was whispering in my ear I do not know what that was The only thing I could ... I think you have to laugh. I was like Joe Cocker I could not talk I could not talk I was shaking because I tried to talk, I was using all my force I was paralyzing, that&#39;s why they call it sleep paralysis It took about a minute, a minute was an hour for me Whisper, I saw the shadow above me in the wall. The shadow slowly went back Pillow and blanket went back on my head. The shadow went back up I was able to move again. That was my experience, I know that&#39;s not normal That I am not crazy, you know Yes, I have a special way of explaining I am so sorry (Giggle) (Giggle) Give me a second (and more laughter) (little more laughter) When I got the giggles, it is very serious (why not, one more time ...Giggle) Please stop Ok, you&#39;ve experienced that. When did that happened? 2011 You never experienced anymore?
- No Never experienced it, it was the first and last time I have little knowledge about this. In my opinion, it might had a relation with the phase you went through because of your relationship It could have a connection with negative experiences in lives Some people have it their entire life, but... Do you know it? Does people have it their entire life?
- Not always Some do, some not Some become very aggressive There is a couple, the woman should sleep separately because the man become extremely aggressive But also dangerous situations Is it not suppressed feelings? Are those people not in a negative mindset? That is possible! Psychological!
- I don&#39;t know much about it But that&#39;s just a thought The feeling that you have no grip The feeling that things slip through your fingers I can imagine. But I&#39;m not sure, I need to investigate I talk once in 80 centuries with Amanda, who is specialized in sleep paralysis She has ever experienced in the hospital. She has very nice content I could tell about exactly what happened, how I felt, it was not a dream However, But dreams can seem real, I have to mention that But I&#39;m not crazy, it&#39;s anything but a dream or a nightmare I&#39;m not emotionally adjacent, for example drama about a broken relationship I was alerted about a vindictive person, who is known for voodoo I thought &quot;Whatever&quot;. Than, that happened Then you make the link I have to research this matter. I think things emerge from the past life Such as blockades or feelings emerge from past lives If you are working on yourself when you have the sleep paralysis It&#39;s not a judgment, I may be wrong If you are working on yourself, that it will decrease, when you are experience the sleep paralysis You&#39;ve experienced it once. Maybe it gave you boost so it did not happen anymore Maybe the people who are watching this needs to be aware that they decide Still loosing too much control over their lives But that&#39;s just a theory Ok, controlling the experience? Control over their lives, control of the situation in their lives That could reflect into a sleep paralysis, because they can&#39;t control that either I&#39;m a type of guy. If I go for a woman, I give 100%. Sometimes you leave yourself out of account That might be what you mean, losing control It could be something psychologically Go to the doctor, swallowing some pills Give some antidepressants Than you will become crazy I have wrote plenty of articles about it, It is really rubbish Do you want to see Annemarie back at Lions Ground?
