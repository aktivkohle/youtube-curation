GREATEST.</text><text start="76.22" dur="14.98">ABANDON ALL HOPES OF RESULTS.</text><text start="91.2" dur="9.24">The first sutra:
GRASP THE PRINCIPLE OF TWO WITNESSES.</text><text start="100.44" dur="19.62">It is one of the most important sutras, one
of the very fundamentals of inner alchemy.</text><text start="120.06" dur="9.76">Let
it sink deep in your heart.</text><text start="129.82" dur="12.45">It can transform you, it can give you a new
birth, a new vision,</text><text start="142.27" dur="2.67">a new universe.</text><text start="144.94" dur="12.659">It has two meanings; both meanings have to
be understood.</text><text start="157.599" dur="17.163">The first meaning: there are two kinds of
witnesses.</text><text start="174.762" dur="5.828">One kind is the people that surround
you.</text><text start="180.59" dur="7.46">You are constantly aware that you are being
watched, witnessed.</text><text start="188.05" dur="7.6">It creates selfconsciousness
in you.</text><text start="195.65" dur="19.419">Hence the fear when you are on a stage facing
a big crowd.</text><text start="215.069" dur="11.2">Actors
feel it, poets feel it, orators feel it -- and</text><text start="226.269" dur="9.131">not only the beginners but even those who
have</text><text start="235.4" dur="6.22">wasted their whole life in acting.</text><text start="241.62" dur="7.88">When they come on the stage a great trembling
arises in</text><text start="249.5" dur="11.81">them, a great fear, as to whether they will
be able to make it or not.</text><text start="261.31" dur="9.199">With so many eyes watching you, you are reduced
to an object.</text><text start="270.509" dur="8.031">You are no more a
subjectivity, you have become a thing.</text><text start="278.54" dur="9.45">And you are afraid because they may not
appreciate you.</text><text start="287.99" dur="13.56">They may not feed your ego, they may not like
you, they may reject you.</text><text start="301.55" dur="7.5">Now you are in their hands.</text><text start="309.05" dur="4.27">You are reduced to a dependent slave.</text><text start="313.32" dur="16.349">Now you have to
work in such a way that you will be appreciated.</text><text start="329.669" dur="10.461">You have to buttress their egos, so that
in response you can hope they will buttress</text><text start="340.13" dur="3.65">your ego.</text><text start="343.78" dur="9.669">When you are with your friends you are not
so afraid.</text><text start="353.449" dur="9.151">You know them, they are
predictable, you depend on each other.</text><text start="362.6" dur="10.539">But when you face the anonymous crowd, more
fear arises.</text><text start="373.139" dur="11.721">Your whole being starts trembling, your whole
ego is at stake -- you can fail.</text><text start="384.86" dur="4.69">Who knows?</text><text start="389.55" dur="2.75">Your success is not guaranteed.</text><text start="392.3" dur="6.269">This is the first kind of witness.</text><text start="398.569" dur="8.641">Others are witnessing you, and you are just
a beggar.</text><text start="407.21" dur="5.63">This is the situation in which millions of
people live.</text><text start="412.84" dur="11.41">They live for others, hence they
only appear to live, they don&amp;#39;t live in reality.</text><text start="424.25" dur="9.39">They are always adjusting to others, because
they are happy only if others are happy with</text><text start="433.64" dur="2.999">them.</text><text start="436.639" dur="12.171">They are compromising constantly,
they are selling their souls, for a simple</text><text start="448.81" dur="10.68">reason -- so their ego can be strengthened,
so that</text><text start="459.49" dur="7.12">they can become famous, well known.</text><text start="466.61" dur="16.05">Have you observed something of immense value,
that whenever a poet, a novelist or a</text><text start="482.66" dur="13.83">scientist gets a Nobel prize, immediately
after that his creativity declines?</text><text start="496.49" dur="8.76">No Nobel
laureate has been able to produce anything</text><text start="505.25" dur="12.47">valuable compared to the things that he
created before he received it.</text><text start="517.72" dur="2.08">What happens?</text><text start="519.8" dur="8.67">Now you have attained the goal of the ego,
there is no further to go, so there is no</text><text start="528.47" dur="7.66">more need to adjust to people.</text><text start="536.13" dur="10.45">Once a book
becomes famous the author dies.</text><text start="546.58" dur="7">That&amp;#39;s what happened with Kahlil Gibran&amp;#39;s
The Prophet.</text><text start="553.58" dur="9.119">That&amp;#39;s what happened with
Rabindranath&amp;#39;s Gitanjali.</text><text start="562.699" dur="5.101">And that is almost the rule, not the exception.</text><text start="567.8" dur="9.06">Once you are
famous you stop compromising.</text><text start="576.86" dur="2.69">For what?</text><text start="579.55" dur="2.35">You are already famous.</text><text start="581.9" dur="6.36">And when you stop
compromising, people start neglecting you,</text><text start="588.26" dur="1.71">ignoring you.</text><text start="589.97" dur="10.86">Your whole creativity was
rooted in the desire of the ego; now the ego</text><text start="600.83" dur="6.82">feels at rest, all creativity disappears.</text><text start="607.65" dur="12.36">This is the situation in which ninety-nine
point nine percent of people live.</text><text start="620.01" dur="7.8">You know
only one kind of witness -- the other.</text><text start="627.81" dur="2.93">And the other is always anxiety-creating.</text><text start="630.74" dur="7.219">Jean-Paul Sartre rightly says, &amp;quot;The other
is hell.&amp;quot;</text><text start="637.959" dur="5.221">The other does not allow you to relax.</text><text start="643.18" dur="10.25">Why do you feel so relaxed in your bathroom,
in your bathtub? -- because the other is not</text><text start="653.43" dur="1">there.</text><text start="654.43" dur="6.32">But relaxing in your bathtub, if you suddenly
become aware that somebody is</text><text start="660.75" dur="10.19">looking at you through the keyhole, suddenly
all relaxation disappears.</text><text start="670.94" dur="2.57">You are tense
again.</text><text start="673.51" dur="5.449">You are being watched.</text><text start="678.959" dur="9.401">To create fear in people, down the ages, the
priests have been telling you that God is</text><text start="688.36" dur="10.01">constantly watching you -- constantly watching
you, day in and day out.</text><text start="698.37" dur="4.8">You may be
asleep; he never sleeps, he goes on sitting</text><text start="703.17" dur="6.169">by the bed and watching.</text><text start="709.339" dur="7.24">He not only watches
you, he watches your dreams and your thoughts</text><text start="716.579" dur="1">too.</text><text start="717.579" dur="6.621">So you are not only going to be
punished for your acts, but for your dreams,</text><text start="724.2" dur="8.25">for your thoughts, your desires and your
feelings.</text><text start="732.45" dur="7.23">The priests created great fear in people.</text><text start="739.68" dur="6.19">Just think of God watching continuously.</text><text start="745.87" dur="5.92">No
moment, not even a single moment, is allowed</text><text start="751.79" dur="2.81">when you can be yourself.</text><text start="754.6" dur="14.739">That was a
great strategy for reducing people to things.</text><text start="769.339" dur="8.121">Why do we hanker for the attention of others?
-- because as we are, we are hollow.</text><text start="777.46" dur="6.61">As we
are, we are NOT.</text><text start="784.07" dur="8.8">As we are, we don&amp;#39;t have a center of being.</text><text start="792.87" dur="13.279">We are just noise, a crowd,
a house full of servants quarreling with each</text><text start="806.149" dur="8.151">other because the master is absent or fast
asleep.</text><text start="814.3" dur="11.539">We hanker for other people&amp;#39;s attention so
that at least we can create a pseudocenter.</text><text start="825.839" dur="9.06">If the real is missing, at least we can depend
on a pseudo-center.</text><text start="834.899" dur="7.091">It will give you
an appearance of togetherness, it will make</text><text start="841.99" dur="1.44">you a person.</text><text start="843.43" dur="10.26">You are not an individual --
individuality is the fragrance of a really</text><text start="853.69" dur="7.339">centered being, one who knows who he is.</text><text start="861.029" dur="9.631">But if you are not an individual, then at
least you can be a person, you can attain</text><text start="870.66" dur="1.239">personality.</text><text start="871.899" dur="4.88">And personality has to be begged.</text><text start="876.779" dur="4.591">Individuality is your innermost growth.</text><text start="881.37" dur="4.459">It
is a growth; you need not beg it from anybody</text><text start="885.829" dur="5.231">else, and nobody can give it to you.</text><text start="891.06" dur="6.829">Individuality is your unfoldment.</text><text start="897.889" dur="5.731">But personality can be begged, people can
give it to you</text><text start="903.62" dur="6.409">-- in fact, only other people can give it
to you.</text><text start="910.029" dur="5.671">If you are alone in the forest you will not
have any personality, remember.</text><text start="915.7" dur="7.23">You will have
individuality but no personality at all.</text><text start="922.93" dur="4.87">If you are alone in the Himalayas, who are
you -- a</text><text start="927.8" dur="3.76">saint or a sinner?</text><text start="931.56" dur="11.709">There is nobody to appreciate you or condemn
you, there is nobody to</text><text start="943.269" dur="8.551">make you famous or notorious, there is nobody
except yourself.</text><text start="951.82" dur="3.68">In your total aloneness,
who are you?</text><text start="955.5" dur="4.85">A sinner or a saint?</text><text start="960.35" dur="13.919">A very very famous person, vvip, or just a
nobody?</text><text start="974.269" dur="3.951">You are neither.</text><text start="978.22" dur="6.669">You are neither a very very important person
nor a nobody, because for</text><text start="984.889" dur="7.461">both the other is a must.</text><text start="992.35" dur="7.44">The eyes of others are needed to reflect your
personality.</text><text start="999.79" dur="4.18">You
are neither this nor that.</text><text start="1003.97" dur="13.76">You are, but you are in your reality; you
are not created by</text><text start="1017.73" dur="1.03">others.</text><text start="1018.76" dur="5.8">You are as you are, in your utter nudeness,
authenticity.</text><text start="1024.56" dur="8.43">This is one of the reasons why many people
thought it wise to escape from the society.</text><text start="1032.99" dur="5.46">It
was not really to escape from the society,</text><text start="1038.45" dur="5.489">it was not really against society, it was
just an</text><text start="1043.939" dur="3.951">effort to renounce the personality.</text><text start="1047.89" dur="7.56">Buddha left his palace.</text><text start="1055.45" dur="10.89">He is not a coward and he is not an escapist,
so why did he leave</text><text start="1066.34" dur="1.62">the palace?</text><text start="1067.96" dur="12.47">Rabindranath has written a beautiful poem
about it.</text><text start="1080.43" dur="14.51">He left the palace; for
twelve years he roamed in the forests, practiced</text><text start="1094.94" dur="1.03">and meditated.</text><text start="1095.97" dur="3.699">And the day of ultimate
rejoicing came, he became enlightened.</text><text start="1099.669" dur="6.941">Naturally, the first thing that he remembered
was</text><text start="1106.61" dur="15.939">that he had to go back to the palace to deliver
the good news to the woman he had loved,</text><text start="1122.549" dur="8.141">to the child that he had left behind, to the
old father who was still hoping that he would</text><text start="1130.69" dur="3.59">come back.</text><text start="1134.28" dur="4.92">It is so human, it touches the heart.</text><text start="1139.2" dur="5.11">After twelve years he returned.</text><text start="1144.31" dur="8.17">His father was angry,
as fathers will be.</text><text start="1152.48" dur="7.74">His father could not see who he was, could
not see what he had</text><text start="1160.22" dur="10.73">become, could not see his individuality which
was so loud and so clear.</text><text start="1170.95" dur="3.41">The whole world
was becoming aware of it, but his father was</text><text start="1174.36" dur="4.01">blind to it.</text><text start="1178.37" dur="10.99">He was still thinking about him
in terms of the personality that was no longer</text><text start="1189.36" dur="5.85">there, that he had renounced the day he left
the palace.</text><text start="1195.21" dur="10.96">In fact Buddha had to leave the palace just
to renounce his personality.</text><text start="1206.17" dur="7.84">He wanted to
know himself as he was, not what others were</text><text start="1214.01" dur="5.419">thinking about him.</text><text start="1219.429" dur="10.331">But the father was
now looking into his face with the eyes of</text><text start="1229.76" dur="7.19">twelve years ago.</text><text start="1236.95" dur="7.26">He again said to Buddha, &amp;quot;I
am your father, I love you -- although you</text><text start="1244.21" dur="5.839">have hurt me deeply and have wounded me
deeply.</text><text start="1250.049" dur="6.231">I am an old man, and these twelve years have
been a torture.</text><text start="1256.28" dur="8.841">You are my only
son, and I have somehow tried to live so that</text><text start="1265.121" dur="1.069">you could come back.</text><text start="1266.19" dur="9.1">Now you are back,
take charge of the empire, be the king!</text><text start="1275.29" dur="9.81">Now let me rest, it is time for me to rest.</text><text start="1285.1" dur="6.959">You
have committed a sin against me, and you have</text><text start="1292.059" dur="12.071">been almost murderous towards me, but I
forgive you and my doors are still open.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1304.13" dur="1.69">Buddha laughed.</text><text start="1305.82" dur="11.969">He said, &amp;quot;Sir, be a little more aware of whom
you are talking with.</text><text start="1317.789" dur="5.931">The
man who left the palace is no more; he died</text><text start="1323.72" dur="1.92">long ago.</text><text start="1325.64" dur="6.72">I am somebody else -- look at me!&amp;quot;</text><text start="1332.36" dur="5.319">And the father became even more angry.</text><text start="1337.679" dur="8.171">He said, &amp;quot;Do you want to deceive me?</text><text start="1345.85" dur="2.36">I don&amp;#39;t
know you?</text><text start="1348.21" dur="5.32">I know you more than you know yourself!</text><text start="1353.53" dur="11.81">I am your father, I have given birth
to you, in your blood my blood circulates</text><text start="1365.34" dur="6.969">-- and I don&amp;#39;t know you?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1372.309" dur="8.37">Buddha said, &amp;quot;Still I pray, sir....</text><text start="1380.679" dur="5.651">You have certainly given birth to me.</text><text start="1386.33" dur="11.65">I came through
you, that&amp;#39;s true, but you were only a vehicle.</text><text start="1397.98" dur="10.78">And just because somebody has come riding
on a horse, it does not mean that the horse</text><text start="1408.76" dur="1.9">knows the rider.</text><text start="1410.66" dur="9.28">I have passed through the
doors of your body, but that does not mean</text><text start="1419.94" dur="2.58">that you know me.</text><text start="1422.52" dur="9.11">In fact, twelve years ago,
even I did not know who I was.</text><text start="1431.63" dur="2.97">Now I know!</text><text start="1434.6" dur="2.33">Look into my eyes.</text><text start="1436.93" dur="8.44">Please forget the past --
be here now!&amp;quot;</text><text start="1445.37" dur="1.89">But the father was incapable.</text><text start="1447.26" dur="10.09">With his old eyes, full of tears of anger
and joy, he could</text><text start="1457.35" dur="3.78">not see what had happened to Buddha.</text><text start="1461.13" dur="4.39">&amp;quot;What nonsense is he talking about, that he
has</text><text start="1465.52" dur="7.139">died and is reborn, that he is a totally different
individuality?</text><text start="1472.659" dur="4.311">That he is no more a
personality, that he is an individuality?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1476.97" dur="8.12">In dictionaries, &amp;quot;personality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;individuality&amp;quot;
are synonyms.</text><text start="1485.09" dur="4.8">They are not
synonymous in life.</text><text start="1489.89" dur="9.08">The personality is false, a pretension, a
facade.</text><text start="1498.97" dur="3.7">Individuality is your
truth.</text><text start="1502.67" dur="8.47">Why do we 
want many many people to give attention to</text><text start="1511.14" dur="1">us?</text><text start="1512.14" dur="1">Why do we hanker for this?</text><text start="1513.14" dur="3.659">To create personality.</text><text start="1516.799" dur="4.931">And the more personality you create around
yourself, the less is the</text><text start="1521.73" dur="4.19">possibility of knowing your individuality.</text><text start="1525.92" dur="9.639">And when Buddha went to see his wife, she
was even more angry.</text><text start="1535.559" dur="7.011">She asked only one
question, a very significant one.</text><text start="1542.57" dur="4.53">She said, &amp;quot;I have only one question to ask
you.</text><text start="1547.1" dur="5.14">I have
waited for all these years, and I have only</text><text start="1552.24" dur="1.23">one question.</text><text start="1553.47" dur="4.959">The question is simple, but be
honest.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1558.429" dur="6.061">She still thinks that Buddha can be dishonest!</text><text start="1564.49" dur="8.55">&amp;quot;Be honest, be true, and just tell
me one thing.</text><text start="1573.04" dur="8.67">Whatever you have attained in the forest,
was it impossible to attain it here</text><text start="1581.71" dur="3.98">in the palace?</text><text start="1585.69" dur="12.099">Is God only in the forest and not here in
the marketplace?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1597.789" dur="5.281">Her question is of tremendous significance.</text><text start="1603.07" dur="9.74">Buddha said, &amp;quot;Yes, the truth is as much here
as it is there.</text><text start="1612.81" dur="6.54">But it would have been very
difficult for me to know it here, because</text><text start="1619.35" dur="4.63">I was lost in a personality -- the personality
of</text><text start="1623.98" dur="7.92">the prince, the personality of a husband,
the personality of a father, the personality</text><text start="1631.9" dur="1.509">of a
son.</text><text start="1633.409" dur="7.281">The personality was too much.</text><text start="1640.69" dur="5.59">I never left the palace really, I was only
leaving my</text><text start="1646.28" dur="7.83">personality behind so that there would be
nobody to remind me who I was, and I could</text><text start="1654.11" dur="7.819">answer the question &amp;#39;Who am I?&amp;#39; on my own.</text><text start="1661.929" dur="3.971">I wanted to encounter myself.</text><text start="1665.9" dur="4.84">I was not
interested in others&amp;#39; answers.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1670.74" dur="5.23">But everybody else is interested in others&amp;#39;
answers.</text><text start="1675.97" dur="4">How much you love it when
somebody says, &amp;quot;You are so beautiful.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1679.97" dur="14.39">Sarvesh was saying to Mukta, &amp;quot;I feel a little
lost.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1694.36" dur="1.439">Naturally.</text><text start="1695.799" dur="10.461">He is one of the best
ventriloquists the world knows; he has lived</text><text start="1706.26" dur="17.279">the life of a showman -- always on the stage,
lights flooding him from everywhere, thousands</text><text start="1723.539" dur="9.551">of people absolutely alert, watching
what he is doing with great appreciation.</text><text start="1733.09" dur="19.78">He has talent, genius, and he has lived flooded
with others&amp;#39; attentions.</text><text start="1752.87" dur="14.27">Now naturally in this commune nobody comes
to say to him, &amp;quot;Sarvesh, you are great.</text><text start="1767.14" dur="4.539">Sarvesh you are this, you are that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1771.679" dur="10.47">He must be feeling a little bit lost.</text><text start="1782.149" dur="6.061">That is a problem
for people who are public figures, it is very</text><text start="1788.21" dur="4.81">difficult for them to drop their personality.</text><text start="1793.02" dur="12.19">But he is trying, and I am certain that he
will succeed.</text><text start="1805.21" dur="2.66">It is going to happen.</text><text start="1807.87" dur="7.429">On one hand
he has hankered for the attention of others,</text><text start="1815.299" dur="4.6">but sooner or later you become tired of it
too,</text><text start="1819.899" dur="4.431">because it is just artificial food.</text><text start="1824.33" dur="9.8">Maybe it tastes good, maybe its flavor is
beautiful, but it</text><text start="1834.13" dur="8.039">does not nourish, it does not give you vitality.</text><text start="1842.169" dur="6.591">Personality is a showpiece.</text><text start="1848.76" dur="4.79">It can deceive others, but it cannot deceive
you, at least not</text><text start="1853.55" dur="2.85">for long.</text><text start="1856.4" dur="9.99">That&amp;#39;s why Sarvesh has come here, tired, exhausted
by all the attention.</text><text start="1866.39" dur="4.12">But old
habit persists a little longer.</text><text start="1870.51" dur="4.91">Sooner or later he will start enjoying himself,
sooner or later</text><text start="1875.42" dur="5.17">he will start enjoying his individuality.</text><text start="1880.59" dur="9.61">And the day you can enjoy your individuality,
you are free -- free from dependence on</text><text start="1890.2" dur="1.099">others.</text><text start="1891.299" dur="9.211">If you ask for their attention you have to
pay for it in return.</text><text start="1900.51" dur="3.659">It is a bondage.</text><text start="1904.169" dur="4.12">The
more you ask people to be attentive towards</text><text start="1908.289" dur="14.541">you, the more you are becoming a thing, a
commodity, which can be sold and purchased.</text><text start="1922.83" dur="10.2">That&amp;#39;s what happens to all public figures
-- to politicians, to showbiz people.</text><text start="1933.03" dur="16.249">This is one
kind of witnessing; you want to be witnessed.</text><text start="1949.279" dur="6.241">It gives you respectability, and in order
to</text><text start="1955.52" dur="11.55">have respectability you will have to create
character and morality.</text><text start="1967.07" dur="8.55">But all that character
and all that morality is just hypocrisy.</text><text start="1975.62" dur="7.08">You create it with a motivation, so that others
can</text><text start="1982.7" dur="9.16">be attracted towards you.</text><text start="1991.86" dur="8.83">If you want respectability you will have to
be a conformist, you will have to be obedient</text><text start="2000.69" dur="5.859">to the society and its demands.</text><text start="2006.549" dur="5.901">You will have to live according to wrong values,
because</text><text start="2012.45" dur="10.5">the society consists of people who are fast
asleep -- their values cannot be right values.</text><text start="2022.95" dur="11.589">Yes, but there is one thing: you can become
a saint.</text><text start="2034.539" dur="6.83">That&amp;#39;s how thousands of your saints
are.</text><text start="2041.369" dur="10.171">They have sacrificed everything at the altar
of respectability.</text><text start="2051.54" dur="12.17">They have tortured
themselves, they have been suicidal, but they</text><text start="2063.71" dur="1">have gained one thing.</text><text start="2064.71" dur="8.949">They have become
saints, people worship them.</text><text start="2073.659" dur="10.061">If you want that kind of worship, respectability,
sainthood, then you will become more</text><text start="2083.72" dur="9.12">and more false, more and more pseudo, more
and more plastic.</text><text start="2092.84" dur="4.36">You will never be a real
rose.</text><text start="2097.2" dur="6.47">And that is the greatest calamity in life
that can happen to a man, to be a plastic</text><text start="2103.67" dur="6.659">rose
and not to be a real rose.</text><text start="2110.329" dur="10.151">The second kind of witnessing is totally different,
just the polar opposite.</text><text start="2120.48" dur="8.46">It is not that
you hanker for others&amp;#39; attention; on the contrary,</text><text start="2128.94" dur="5.48">you start paying attention to yourself.</text><text start="2134.42" dur="6.32">You become a witness to your own being.</text><text start="2140.74" dur="11.3">You start watching your thoughts, desires,
dreams, motives, greeds and jealousies.</text><text start="2152.04" dur="3.5">You create a new kind of awareness within
you.</text><text start="2155.54" dur="10">You become a center, a silent center which
goes on watching whatsoever is happening.</text><text start="2165.54" dur="3.23">You are angry, and you watch it.</text><text start="2168.77" dur="5.52">You are not just angry, a new element is introduced
into</text><text start="2174.29" dur="3.26">it: you are watching it.</text><text start="2177.55" dur="4.15">And the miracle is that if you can watch anger,
the anger</text><text start="2181.7" dur="4.77">disappears without being repressed.</text><text start="2186.47" dur="8.649">The first kind of saint will have to repress
it.</text><text start="2195.119" dur="3.531">He will have to repress his sexuality, he
will</text><text start="2198.65" dur="3.87">have to repress his greed.</text><text start="2202.52" dur="3.809">And the more you repress anything, the deeper
it goes into your</text><text start="2206.329" dur="1">unconscious.</text><text start="2207.329" dur="7.511">It becomes part of your basement and it starts
affecting your life from there.</text><text start="2214.84" dur="15.44">It is like a wound that is oozing with pus,
but you have covered it.</text><text start="2230.28" dur="6.38">Just by covering it, you
don&amp;#39;t become healthy, it does not heal.</text><text start="2236.66" dur="6.64">In fact by covering it you are helping it
to grow</text><text start="2243.3" dur="3.2">more and more.</text><text start="2246.5" dur="11.68">Your saints stink, stink of all kinds of repressions.</text><text start="2258.18" dur="6.21">The second kind of witnessing creates a totally
different kind of person.</text><text start="2264.39" dur="1.231">It creates the
sage.</text><text start="2265.621" dur="10.259">The sage is one who knows who he is, not according
to others.</text><text start="2275.88" dur="14.189">The sage is one who
lives a life according to his own nature,</text><text start="2290.069" dur="4.151">not according to others&amp;#39; values.</text><text start="2294.22" dur="7.629">He has his own
vision and the courage to live it.</text><text start="2301.849" dur="3.431">The sage is rebellious.</text><text start="2305.28" dur="11.579">The saint is obedient, orthodox, conventional,
traditional,</text><text start="2316.859" dur="2.25">conformist.</text><text start="2319.109" dur="8.73">The sage is nonconformist, nontraditional,
nonconventional, rebellious.</text><text start="2327.839" dur="10">Rebellion is the very taste of his being.</text><text start="2337.839" dur="3.871">He is not dependent on others.</text><text start="2341.71" dur="13.22">He knows what
freedom is, and he knows the joys of freedom.</text><text start="2354.93" dur="5.51">The saint will be followed by a big crowd.</text><text start="2360.44" dur="8.68">The sage will have only the chosen people
who will be able to understand him.</text><text start="2369.12" dur="11.81">The sage will be misunderstood by the masses,
the saint will be worshipped.</text><text start="2380.93" dur="9.47">The sage
will be condemned by the masses, maybe even</text><text start="2390.4" dur="2.36">murdered.</text><text start="2392.76" dur="6.8">Jesus is crucified and the pope
is worshipped.</text><text start="2399.56" dur="9.15">Jesus is a sage and the pope is a saint.</text><text start="2408.71" dur="13.74">The saint has character and the sage has consciousness.</text><text start="2422.45" dur="3.2">And there is a tremendous
difference.</text><text start="2425.65" dur="9.82">They are as different as the earth and the
sky.</text><text start="2435.47" dur="10.71">Character is imposed for some
ulterior motives -- to gain respectability</text><text start="2446.18" dur="8.98">in this world and to have more and more
heavenly pleasures.</text><text start="2455.16" dur="10.929">Consciousness has no future, no motivation,
it is a joy unto itself.</text><text start="2466.089" dur="5.081">It
is not a means to some end, it is an end unto</text><text start="2471.17" dur="2.73">itself.</text><text start="2473.9" dur="8.77">To be with a saint is to be with an imitator.</text><text start="2482.67" dur="6.62">To be with a sage is to be with something
true</text><text start="2489.29" dur="5.68">and authentic.</text><text start="2494.97" dur="5.29">To be with a saint is to be with a teacher,
at the most.</text><text start="2500.26" dur="9.14">To be with a sage is
to be with a master.</text><text start="2509.4" dur="3.679">These are the two witnesses.</text><text start="2513.079" dur="6.041">Atisha says:
GRASP THE PRINCIPLE OF TWO WITNESSES.</text><text start="2519.12" dur="10.229">Avoid the first and plunge into the second.</text><text start="2529.349" dur="10.401">There is another meaning to this sutra too.</text><text start="2539.75" dur="7.8">The other meaning is, first witness the objects
of the mind.</text><text start="2547.55" dur="5.58">This is a higher meaning than the first.</text><text start="2553.13" dur="2.58">Witness the objects of the mind.</text><text start="2555.71" dur="11.7">Patanjali calls it dhyana, meditation -- from
the same word come zen and CH&amp;#39;AN.</text><text start="2567.41" dur="7.81">Witness the objects, the contents, of the
mind.</text><text start="2575.22" dur="10.66">Whatsoever passes before you, watch it,
without evaluating, judging or condemning.</text><text start="2585.88" dur="11.68">Don&amp;#39;t be for or against, just watch, and
dhyana, meditation, is created.</text><text start="2597.56" dur="9.039">And the second is, witness the witness itself
-- and samadhi is created, satori is created,</text><text start="2606.599" dur="6.791">the ultimate ecstasy is created.</text><text start="2613.39" dur="3.73">The first leads to the second.</text><text start="2617.12" dur="6.68">Start watching your thoughts
but don&amp;#39;t stop there.</text><text start="2623.8" dur="6.51">When thoughts have disappeared then don&amp;#39;t
think that you have</text><text start="2630.31" dur="1.21">arrived.</text><text start="2631.52" dur="5.7">One more thing has to be done, one more step.</text><text start="2637.22" dur="4.889">Now watch the watcher.</text><text start="2642.109" dur="5.271">Now just
witness the witnessing.</text><text start="2647.38" dur="8.67">Nothing else is left, only you are.</text><text start="2656.05" dur="11.17">Just suddenly become aware of
awareness itself, and then dhyana is transformed</text><text start="2667.22" dur="4.48">into samadhi.</text><text start="2671.7" dur="4.2">By watching the mind, the
mind disappears.</text><text start="2675.9" dur="10.92">By watching the witness, the witness expands
and becomes universal.</text><text start="2686.82" dur="4.57">The first is a negative step to get rid of
the mind.</text><text start="2691.39" dur="8.25">The second is a positive step to get
rooted in the ultimate consciousness -- call</text><text start="2699.64" dur="9.3">it God or nirvana or whatever you wish.</text><text start="2708.94" dur="13.04">The second sutra:
ALWAYS RELY ON JUST A HAPPY FRAME OF MIND.</text><text start="2721.98" dur="10.389">If you are unhappy, that simply means that
you have learned tricks for being unhappy,</text><text start="2732.369" dur="4.75">and nothing else.</text><text start="2737.119" dur="5.641">Unhappiness depends on the frame of your mind.</text><text start="2742.76" dur="10.39">There are people who
are unhappy in all kinds of situations.</text><text start="2753.15" dur="5.969">They have a certain quality in their mind
which</text><text start="2759.119" dur="4.551">transforms everything into unhappiness.</text><text start="2763.67" dur="3.05">If you tell them about the beauty of the rose
they</text><text start="2766.72" dur="3.09">immediately start counting the thorns.</text><text start="2769.81" dur="21.09">If you say to them, &amp;quot;What a beautiful morning,
what a sunny day!&amp;quot; they will look at you as</text><text start="2790.9" dur="3.75">if they are surprised by your statement.</text><text start="2794.65" dur="3.11">They
will say, &amp;quot;So what!</text><text start="2797.76" dur="3.739">One day between two dark nights!</text><text start="2801.499" dur="13.781">It is only one day between two
dark nights, so what is the big deal?</text><text start="2815.28" dur="3.02">Why are you looking so fascinated?&amp;quot;</text><text start="2818.3" dur="4.799">The same thing can be seen from a positive
reference; then suddenly each night is</text><text start="2823.099" dur="1">surrounded by two days.</text><text start="2824.099" dur="5.301">And then suddenly it is a miracle that the
rose is possible, that</text><text start="2829.4" dur="11.28">such a delicate flower is possible among so
many thorns.</text><text start="2840.68" dur="3.689">Everything is the same.</text><text start="2844.369" dur="11.361">All depends on what kind of frame you are
carrying in your head.</text><text start="2855.73" dur="10.17">Millions of people are carrying crosses; naturally,
obviously, they are burdened.</text><text start="2865.9" dur="3.83">Their
life is a drag.</text><text start="2869.73" dur="5.027">Their frame is such that it immediately becomes
focused on everything that</text><text start="2874.757" dur="1">is negative.</text><text start="2875.757" dur="6.733">It magnifies the negative; it is a morbid
approach towards life, pathological.</text><text start="2882.49" dur="1">But they go on thinking, &amp;quot;What can we do?</text><text start="2883.49" dur="1">The world is such.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2884.49" dur="2.51">No, the world is not such!</text><text start="2887" dur="5.89">The world is absolutely neutral.</text><text start="2892.89" dur="14.15">It has thorns, it has roses, it
has nights, it has days.</text><text start="2907.04" dur="6.39">The world is utterly neutral, balanced, it
has all.</text><text start="2913.43" dur="5.4">Now it depends
on you as to what you choose.</text><text start="2918.83" dur="7.16">If you have decided to choose only the wrong,
you will</text><text start="2925.99" dur="7.72">live in a wrong kind of world, because you
will live in your own chosen world.</text><text start="2933.71" dur="7.99">That&amp;#39;s how people create hell and heaven on
the same earth.</text><text start="2941.7" dur="9.45">It looks very unbelievable
that Buddha lived on this earth with the same</text><text start="2951.15" dur="5.08">kind of people, and lived in paradise.</text><text start="2956.23" dur="5.89">And
you also live on the same earth with the same</text><text start="2962.12" dur="4.65">kind of people, and you live in hell.</text><text start="2966.77" dur="2.91">Now, there are two possibilities.</text><text start="2969.68" dur="3.05">The political mind says, &amp;quot;Change the world.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2972.73" dur="2.56">The
religious mind says, &amp;quot;Change the frame of</text><text start="2975.29" dur="1">your mind.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2976.29" dur="3.12">Religion and politics are diametrically opposite.</text><text start="2979.41" dur="14.199">There is a possibility one day of a
meeting of science and religion.</text><text start="2993.609" dur="10.5">Sooner or later, science and religion are
bound to meet,</text><text start="3004.109" dur="6.291">because their approach is very similar.</text><text start="3010.4" dur="8.46">Maybe the direction is different -- science
searches the outer, and religion the inner.</text><text start="3018.86" dur="6.979">But the search, the quality of the search,
is the</text><text start="3025.839" dur="1">same.</text><text start="3026.839" dur="4.821">The spirit of the search is the same.</text><text start="3031.66" dur="12.919">But I don&amp;#39;t see any possibility that politics
and religion can ever meet.</text><text start="3044.579" dur="4.521">Politics always
thinks the world is wrong; change the society,</text><text start="3049.1" dur="2.07">the economic structure, this and that, and
everything will be okay.</text><text start="3051.17" dur="8.97">And religion says the world has always been
the same and will</text><text start="3060.14" dur="10.31">remain the same; you can change only one thing
-- the context of your mind, the space of</text><text start="3070.45" dur="2.81">your mind.</text><text start="3073.26" dur="7.32">ALWAYS RELY ON JUST A HAPPY FRAME OF MIND.</text><text start="3080.58" dur="6.96">Let it become one of the fundamental rules
of your life.</text><text start="3087.54" dur="11.02">Even if you come across a
negative, find something positive in it.</text><text start="3098.56" dur="4.55">You will always be able to find something.</text><text start="3103.11" dur="5.68">And
the day you become skillful at finding the</text><text start="3108.79" dur="7.269">positive in the negative, you will dance with
joy.</text><text start="3116.059" dur="7.441">Try it, try the new vision of life.</text><text start="3123.5" dur="7.15">Think in terms of optimism, don&amp;#39;t be a pessimist.</text><text start="3130.65" dur="4.6">The
pessimist creates hell around himself and</text><text start="3135.25" dur="6.99">lives in it -- you live in the world you create.</text><text start="3142.24" dur="9.46">Remember, there is not only one world, there
are as many worlds as there are minds in</text><text start="3151.7" dur="1">the world.</text><text start="3152.7" dur="8.04">I live in my world, you live in your own world.</text><text start="3160.74" dur="9.609">They are not only different,
they never overlap.</text><text start="3170.349" dur="10.23">They are utterly different, they exist on
different planes.</text><text start="3180.579" dur="8.361">Atisha makes it a fundamental rule for his
disciples to live in a happy frame of mind.</text><text start="3188.94" dur="7.34">Then you start turning each opportunity into
a challenge for growth.</text><text start="3196.28" dur="4.25">For example,
somebody insults you.</text><text start="3200.53" dur="6.819">Now it is so clear that you have been insulted,
how can you</text><text start="3207.349" dur="6.75">practice a happy frame of mind now?</text><text start="3214.099" dur="5">Yes, it can be practiced.</text><text start="3219.099" dur="8.52">Insult a buddha and you
will know.</text><text start="3227.619" dur="6.081">Gautam Buddha was insulted once.</text><text start="3233.7" dur="11.669">He was passing by a village, and the villagers
were</text><text start="3245.369" dur="3.181">very against him.</text><text start="3248.55" dur="4.759">It was impossible for them to comprehend what
he was teaching.</text><text start="3253.309" dur="5.451">Compared to the buddhas, the whole world is
always very primitive, very</text><text start="3258.76" dur="1.37">unsophisticated, very stupid.</text><text start="3260.13" dur="3.429">The people gathered and insulted him very
much.</text><text start="3263.559" dur="6.921">Buddha listened very silently and then he
said, &amp;quot;If you are finished, can I take leave</text><text start="3270.48" dur="7">of
you, because I have to reach the other village,</text><text start="3277.48" dur="5.66">and they must be waiting for me.</text><text start="3283.14" dur="5.6">If you are
not finished, then when I return tomorrow</text><text start="3288.74" dur="5.9">morning you can come again and finish your
job.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3294.64" dur="4.07">One man from the crowd asked, &amp;quot;Have you not
heard us?</text><text start="3298.71" dur="1.639">We have been insulting you,
abusing you.</text><text start="3300.349" dur="4.601">We have been using all kinds of dirty words,
anything that we can find.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3304.95" dur="1">Buddha laughed.</text><text start="3305.95" dur="5.93">He said, &amp;quot;You have come a little too late
-- you should have come ten</text><text start="3311.88" dur="1">years ago.</text><text start="3312.88" dur="13.35">Then I was in the same frame of mind as you
are; then I would have replied,</text><text start="3326.23" dur="1">and replied well.</text><text start="3327.23" dur="5.16">But now this is simply an opportunity for
me to be compassionate, to be</text><text start="3332.39" dur="1">meditative.</text><text start="3333.39" dur="1">I am thankful to you that you allowed me this
opportunity.</text><text start="3334.39" dur="9.35">This is just a test -
- a test of whether or not I have anything</text><text start="3343.74" dur="2.879">of the negative lurking anywhere in my
unconscious mind.</text><text start="3346.619" dur="7.45">&amp;quot;And I am happy to declare to you, friends,
that not even a single shadow of the negative</text><text start="3354.069" dur="2.49">has passed through my mind.</text><text start="3356.559" dur="5.02">I have remained utterly blissful, you have
not been able to</text><text start="3361.579" dur="2.581">affect me in any way.</text><text start="3364.16" dur="3.439">And I am tremendously happy that you gave
me such a great</text><text start="3367.599" dur="1">opportunity.</text><text start="3368.599" dur="3.041">Very few people are as kind as you are.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3371.64" dur="5.09">This is how one should use situations, this
is how a sannyasin should use negative</text><text start="3376.73" dur="2.53">opportunities for inner growth, for inner
understanding, for meditativeness, for love,</text><text start="3379.26" dur="1">for
compassion.</text><text start="3380.26" dur="2.48">And once you have learned this happy frame
of mind, this positive vision of</text><text start="3382.74" dur="6.35">life, you will be surprised that the whole
existence starts functioning in a totally</text><text start="3389.09" dur="1.219">different
way.</text><text start="3390.309" dur="4.361">It starts mothering you.</text><text start="3394.67" dur="3.28">It starts helping you in every possible way,
it becomes a</text><text start="3397.95" dur="1">great friend.</text><text start="3398.95" dur="2.58">And to know this is to know God.</text><text start="3401.53" dur="5.36">To know this, that existence mothers you,
is to know</text><text start="3406.89" dur="1">God.</text><text start="3407.89" dur="2.67">There is no other God -- just this feeling,
this tremendous feeling, this penetrating</text><text start="3410.56" dur="5.62">feeling, that the existence loves you, protects
you, helps you and showers many many</text><text start="3416.18" dur="4.99">blessings on you; that the existence is graceful
towards you, that you are not alienated,</text><text start="3421.17" dur="4.879">that you are not a stranger, that this is
your home.</text><text start="3426.049" dur="7.03">To feel that &amp;quot;This existence is my home&amp;quot; is
to know God.</text><text start="3433.079" dur="7.411">The third sutra:
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE DISTRACTED, IF YOU CAN</text><text start="3440.49" dur="4.59">DO IT, IT IS STILL MIND
TRAINING.</text><text start="3445.08" dur="3.23">Yes, sometimes you will be distracted.</text><text start="3448.31" dur="9.94">You are not yet all buddhas -- there will
be times</text><text start="3458.25" dur="15.569">when you will be distracted, there will be
times when you will be dragged down by the</text><text start="3473.819" dur="4.381">negative, sucked in by the old habit.</text><text start="3478.2" dur="9.609">And by the time you know, it has already happened;
you are miserable.</text><text start="3487.809" dur="8.881">The shadow has fallen on you, that sunlit
peak has disappeared, you</text><text start="3496.69" dur="3.72">have fallen into the dark valley.</text><text start="3500.41" dur="4.409">Then what to do in those moments?</text><text start="3504.819" dur="6.422">Atisha says:
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE DISTRACTED, IF YOU CAN</text><text start="3511.241" dur="1.199">DO IT, IT IS STILL MIND
TRAINING.</text><text start="3512.44" dur="1">What does he mean by &amp;quot;if you can do it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="3513.44" dur="2.37">This is of great importance.</text><text start="3515.81" dur="8.5">If you can be
attentive to your inattention, if you can</text><text start="3524.31" dur="10.11">be aware that you have fallen into the trap
of the</text><text start="3534.42" dur="8.43">negative, it is still meditation, it is still
mind training, you are still growing.</text><text start="3542.85" dur="5.2">Yes, many times you will fall, it is natural.</text><text start="3548.05" dur="5.21">And many times you will forget, it is natural.</text><text start="3553.26" dur="11.32">And many times you will be trapped and it
will take time for you to remember.</text><text start="3564.58" dur="3.47">But the
moment you remember, remember TOTALLY.</text><text start="3568.05" dur="2.08">Wake up totally and say, &amp;quot;I have fallen.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3570.13" dur="3.02">And see the difference.</text><text start="3573.15" dur="8.709">If you ask the ordinary religious person he
will say, &amp;quot;Repent --</text><text start="3581.859" dur="1.521">punish yourself.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3583.38" dur="8.41">But Atisha is saying: If you are attentive,
that&amp;#39;s enough.</text><text start="3591.79" dur="8.66">Be attentive to
your inattention, be aware that you have not</text><text start="3600.45" dur="3.07">been aware, that&amp;#39;s all.</text><text start="3603.52" dur="3.069">No repentance is
needed.</text><text start="3606.589" dur="5.46">Don&amp;#39;t feel guilty; it is natural, it is human.</text><text start="3612.049" dur="4.05">To fall many times is not something to
feel guilty about.</text><text start="3616.099" dur="4.24">To commit errors, to go astray, is part of
our human frailty and</text><text start="3620.339" dur="1">limitations.</text><text start="3621.339" dur="1.421">So there is no need to repent.</text><text start="3622.76" dur="1.799">Repentance is ugly.</text><text start="3624.559" dur="6.601">It is like playing with your wound, fingering
your wound.</text><text start="3631.16" dur="5.24">It is
unnecessary, and not only unnecessary but</text><text start="3636.4" dur="8.62">harmful -- the wound may become septic, and
fingering your wound is not going to help</text><text start="3645.02" dur="1.44">it heal either.</text><text start="3646.46" dur="7.68">If you have fallen, just know that you have
fallen, with no guilt, with no repentance.</text><text start="3654.14" dur="2.11">There is no need to go anywhere to confess
it, just knowing it is enough.</text><text start="3656.25" dur="1.14">And knowing it,
you are helping your awareness to grow.</text><text start="3657.39" dur="2.751">Less and less will you fall, because knowing
will become more and more strong in you.</text><text start="3660.141" dur="1.239">The fourth sutra:
ALWAYS OBSERVE THE THREE GENERAL POINTS.</text><text start="3661.38" dur="1">What are the three general points?</text><text start="3662.38" dur="1">The first is regularity of meditativeness.</text><text start="3663.38" dur="1">Remember, it
is very difficult to create meditation, it</text><text start="3664.38" dur="1">is very easy to lose it.</text><text start="3665.38" dur="1">Anything higher takes much
arduous effort to create, but it can disappear</text><text start="3666.38" dur="1">within a moment.</text><text start="3667.38" dur="1">To lose contact with it is
very easy.</text><text start="3668.38" dur="1">That is one of the qualities of the higher.</text><text start="3669.38" dur="1">It is like growing a roseflower -- just a
little hard</text><text start="3670.38" dur="3.419">wind and the rose has withered and the petals
have fallen, or some animal has entered the</text><text start="3673.799" dur="2.32">garden and the rose is eaten.</text><text start="3676.119" dur="3.671">It is very easy to lose it, and it was so
long a journey to</text><text start="3679.79" dur="1">create it.</text><text start="3680.79" dur="5.34">And whenever there is a conflict between the
higher and the lower, always remember, the</text><text start="3686.13" dur="1">lower wins easily.</text><text start="3687.13" dur="6.239">If you clash a roseflower with a rock, the
roseflower is going to die,</text><text start="3693.369" dur="3.551">not the rock.</text><text start="3696.92" dur="9.81">The rock may not even become aware that there
has been a clash, that it has</text><text start="3706.73" dur="1">killed something beautiful.</text><text start="3707.73" dur="4.18">Your whole past is full of rocks, and when
you start growing a rose of awareness in you,</text><text start="3711.91" dur="7.01">there are a thousand and one possibilities
of it being destroyed by your old rocks --</text><text start="3718.92" dur="2.139">habits, mechanical habits.</text><text start="3721.059" dur="6.391">You will have to be very watchful and careful.</text><text start="3727.45" dur="8.149">You will have
to walk like a woman who is pregnant.</text><text start="3735.599" dur="3.661">Hence the man of awareness walks carefully,
lives</text><text start="3739.26" dur="1">carefully.</text><text start="3740.26" dur="2.69">And this has to be a regular phenomenon.</text><text start="3742.95" dur="10.48">It is not that one day you do a little meditation,
then for a few days you forget about it, and</text><text start="3753.43" dur="1.86">then one day you do it again.</text><text start="3755.29" dur="4.75">It has to be as
regular as sleep, as food, as exercise, as</text><text start="3760.04" dur="1">breathing.</text><text start="3761.04" dur="5.24">Only then will the infinite glory of
God open its doors to you.</text><text start="3766.28" dur="6.059">So the first general point is: be regular.</text><text start="3772.339" dur="9.631">The second general point is: don&amp;#39;t waste your
time with the nonessential.</text><text start="3781.97" dur="1.379">Don&amp;#39;t fool
around.</text><text start="3783.349" dur="4.041">Millions of people are wasting their time
with the nonessential, and the irony is</text><text start="3787.39" dur="4.659">that they know that it is nonessential.</text><text start="3792.049" dur="4.671">But they say, &amp;quot;What else to do?&amp;quot;</text><text start="3796.72" dur="2.92">They are not
aware of anything more significant.</text><text start="3799.64" dur="6.29">People are playing cards, and if you ask them,
&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; they say they are</text><text start="3805.93" dur="1.03">killing time.</text><text start="3806.96" dur="1.04">Killing time?</text><text start="3808" dur="1.559">Time is life!</text><text start="3809.559" dur="1">So you are really killing life.</text><text start="3810.559" dur="1.871">And the time that
you are killing cannot be recaptured again;</text><text start="3812.43" dur="2.28">once gone, it is gone forever.</text><text start="3814.71" dur="5.04">The man who wants to become a buddha has to
drop the nonessential more and more, so</text><text start="3819.75" dur="1.829">that more energy is available for the essential.</text><text start="3821.579" dur="10.22">Take a look at your life, how many
nonessential things you are doing -- and for</text><text start="3831.799" dur="1.5">what?</text><text start="3833.299" dur="12.27">And how long you have done them --
and what have you gained?</text><text start="3845.569" dur="10.571">Are you going to repeat the same stupid pattern
your whole</text><text start="3856.14" dur="1">life?</text><text start="3857.14" dur="1.919">Enough is enough!</text><text start="3859.059" dur="2.151">Take a look, meditate over it.</text><text start="3861.21" dur="2.8">Say only that which is essential, do
only that which is essential, read only that</text><text start="3864.01" dur="1.81">which is essential.</text><text start="3865.82" dur="9.031">And so much time is saved
and so much energy is saved, and all that</text><text start="3874.851" dur="1">energy and time can easily be channeled
towards meditation, towards inner growth,</text><text start="3875.851" dur="1">towards witnessing.</text><text start="3876.851" dur="9.799">I have never seen a man who is so poor that
he cannot meditate.</text><text start="3886.65" dur="1.58">But people are engaged
in foolish things, utterly foolish.</text><text start="3888.23" dur="1.569">They don&amp;#39;t look foolish, because everybody
else is also</text><text start="3889.799" dur="1">doing the same.</text><text start="3890.799" dur="1">But the seeker has to be watchful.</text><text start="3891.799" dur="1.551">Take more note of what you are doing, what
you are</text><text start="3893.35" dur="3.24">doing with your life -- because to grow roses
of awareness much energy will be needed, a</text><text start="3896.59" dur="2.02">reservoir of energy will be needed.</text><text start="3898.61" dur="3.2">All that is great comes only when you have
extra</text><text start="3901.81" dur="1">energy.</text><text start="3902.81" dur="1.9">If your whole energy is wasted on the mundane,
then the sacred will never be</text><text start="3904.71" dur="1">contacted.</text><text start="3905.71" dur="1">And the third general point is: don&amp;#39;t rationalize
your errors and mistakes.</text><text start="3906.71" dur="1">The mind tends
to rationalize.</text><text start="3907.71" dur="1">If you commit some mistake, the mind says,
&amp;quot;It had to be so, there were</text><text start="3908.71" dur="2.5">reasons for it.</text><text start="3911.21" dur="7.05">I am not responsible, the very situation made
this happen.&amp;quot;</text><text start="3918.26" dur="3.62">And the mind is
very clever at rationalizing everything.</text><text start="3921.88" dur="2.489">Avoid rationalizing your own errors and mistakes,
because if you rationalize you protect</text><text start="3924.369" dur="1">them.</text><text start="3925.369" dur="1">Then they will be repeated.</text><text start="3926.369" dur="1">Avoid rationalizing your errors.</text><text start="3927.369" dur="1">Stop rationalization
completely.</text><text start="3928.369" dur="1">Reasoning is one thing, rationalization is
totally another.</text><text start="3929.369" dur="1">Reasoning can be
used for some positive purposes, but rationalization</text><text start="3930.369" dur="1">can never be used for any positive
purpose.</text><text start="3931.369" dur="1">And you will be able to find when you are
rationalizing, you can deceive others but</text><text start="3932.369" dur="1">you
cannot deceive yourself.</text><text start="3933.369" dur="1">You know that you have fallen.</text><text start="3934.369" dur="2.521">Rather than wasting time in
rationalizing and convincing yourself that</text><text start="3936.89" dur="1">nothing has gone wrong, put the whole energy
into being aware.</text><text start="3937.89" dur="1">All these general points are to help you so
that you can block the leaks of your energy.</text><text start="3938.89" dur="1">Otherwise God goes on pouring energy into
you, and you have so many leakages that you</text><text start="3939.89" dur="1">are never full.</text><text start="3940.89" dur="1">Energy comes, but leaks out.</text><text start="3941.89" dur="1">The fifth sutra:
CHANGE YOUR INCLINATION AND THEN MAINTAIN</text><text start="3942.89" dur="1">IT.</text><text start="3943.89" dur="1">Change your inclination from the mind to the
heart.</text><text start="3944.89" dur="1">That is the first change.</text><text start="3945.89" dur="1">Think less,
feel more.</text><text start="3946.89" dur="1">Intellectualize less, intuit more.</text><text start="3947.89" dur="1">Thinking is a very deceptive process, it makes
you feel that you are doing great things.</text><text start="3948.89" dur="1">But you are simply making castles in the air.</text><text start="3949.89" dur="1">Thoughts are nothing but castles in the air.</text><text start="3950.89" dur="1">Feelings are more material, more substantial.</text><text start="3951.89" dur="1">They transform you.</text><text start="3952.89" dur="1">Thinking about love is
not going to help, but feeling love is bound</text><text start="3953.89" dur="1">to change you.</text><text start="3954.89" dur="1">Thinking is very much loved
by the ego, because the ego feeds on fictions.</text><text start="3955.89" dur="1">The ego cannot digest any reality, and
thinking is a fictitious process.</text><text start="3956.89" dur="1">It is a kind of dreaming, a sophisticated
dreaming.</text><text start="3957.89" dur="4.51">Dreams
are pictorial and thinking is conceptual,</text><text start="3962.4" dur="3.439">but the process is the same.</text><text start="3965.839" dur="1">Dreaming is a
primitive kind of thinking, and thinking is</text><text start="3966.839" dur="1">a civilized kind of dreaming.</text><text start="3967.839" dur="2.871">Change from the mind to the heart, from thinking
to feeling, from logic to love.</text><text start="3970.71" dur="4.82">And the second change is from the heart to
the being -- because there is a still deeper</text><text start="3975.53" dur="3.2">layer in you where even feelings cannot reach.</text><text start="3978.73" dur="2.8">Remember these three words: mind, heart,
being.</text><text start="3981.53" dur="4.85">The being is your pure nature.</text><text start="3986.38" dur="6.86">Surrounding the being is feeling, and surrounding
feeling is thinking.</text><text start="3993.24" dur="11.72">Thinking is far away from being but feeling
is a little closer; it reflects</text><text start="4004.96" dur="2.149">some glory of the being.</text><text start="4007.109" dur="1.871">It is just as in the sunset the sun is reflected
by the clouds and</text><text start="4008.98" dur="1">the clouds start having beautiful colors.</text><text start="4009.98" dur="4.4">They themselves are not the sun, but they
are</text><text start="4014.38" dur="1.26">reflecting the light of the sun.</text><text start="4015.64" dur="1">Feelings are close to being, so they reflect
something of the being.</text><text start="4016.64" dur="1">But one has to go
beyond feelings too.</text><text start="4017.64" dur="1">Then what is being?</text><text start="4018.64" dur="1">It is neither thinking nor feeling, it is
pure amness.</text><text start="4019.64" dur="1">One simply is.</text><text start="4020.64" dur="1">Thinking is very selfish and egoistic.</text><text start="4021.64" dur="1">Feeling is more altruistic, less egoistic.</text><text start="4022.64" dur="1">Being is noego,
egolessness -- neither selfishness nor altruism</text><text start="4023.64" dur="1">but a spontaneity, a moment-tomoment
responsiveness.</text><text start="4024.64" dur="1">One does not live according to oneself, one
lives according to</text><text start="4025.64" dur="3.199">God, according to the whole.</text><text start="4028.839" dur="1.461">Feeling is half, and no half can ever satisfy
you.</text><text start="4030.3" dur="1">Thinking and feeling are both halves and
you will remain divided.</text><text start="4031.3" dur="1">Being is total, and only the total can bring
contentment.</text><text start="4032.3" dur="1">And the ultimate, the fourth change, is from
being to non-being.</text><text start="4033.3" dur="1">That is nirvana,
enlightenment; one simply disappears, one</text><text start="4034.3" dur="1">simply is not.</text><text start="4035.3" dur="1">God is, enlightenment is.</text><text start="4036.3" dur="1">Light
is, delight is, but there is nobody who is</text><text start="4037.3" dur="1">delighted.</text><text start="4038.3" dur="1">Neti neti: neither this nor that, neither
existence nor nonexistence -- this is the</text><text start="4039.3" dur="1">ultimate state.</text><text start="4040.3" dur="1">Atisha is slowly slowly taking his
disciples towards it.</text><text start="4041.3" dur="1">Let me repeat: from thinking to feeling, from
feeling to being, from being to non-being,</text><text start="4042.3" dur="1">and one has arrived.</text><text start="4043.3" dur="1">One has disappeared and one has arrived.</text><text start="4044.3" dur="1">One is no more, for the
first time.</text><text start="4045.3" dur="1">And for the first time one really is.</text><text start="4046.3" dur="1">The sixth sutra:
DO NOT DISCUSS DEFECTS.</text><text start="4047.3" dur="1">The mind tends to discuss the defects of others.</text><text start="4048.3" dur="1">It helps the ego to feel good.</text><text start="4049.3" dur="1">Everybody
is such a sinner; when everybody is such a</text><text start="4050.3" dur="1">sinner, comparatively one feels like a saint.</text><text start="4051.3" dur="1">When everybody is doing wrong, it feels good
that &amp;quot;At least I am not doing that much</text><text start="4052.3" dur="1">wrong.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4053.3" dur="1">Hence people talk about others&amp;#39; defects; not
only do they talk about them, they go on</text><text start="4054.3" dur="1">magnifying them.</text><text start="4055.3" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s why there is so much joy in gossiping.</text><text start="4056.3" dur="1">When the gossip passes
from one hand to another hand, it becomes</text><text start="4057.3" dur="1">richer.</text><text start="4058.3" dur="1">And when it passes back again,
something will be added to it.</text><text start="4059.3" dur="1">By the evening, if you come to know the gossip
that you</text><text start="4060.3" dur="1">started in the morning, you will be surprised.</text><text start="4061.3" dur="1">In the morning it was just a molehill, now
it</text><text start="4062.3" dur="1">is a mountain.</text><text start="4063.3" dur="1">People are very creative, really creative
and inventive.</text><text start="4064.3" dur="1">Why are people so interested in gossiping
about others, in finding fault with others,</text><text start="4065.3" dur="1">in
looking into others&amp;#39; loopholes and defects?</text><text start="4066.3" dur="1">Why are people continuously trying to look
through others&amp;#39; keyholes?</text><text start="4067.3" dur="1">The reason is, this helps to give them a better
feeling about</text><text start="4068.3" dur="1">themselves.</text><text start="4069.3" dur="1">They become Peeping Toms, just to have a good
feeling, &amp;quot;I am far better.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4070.3" dur="1">There is a motivation.</text><text start="4071.3" dur="1">It is not just to help others -- it is not,
whatsoever they say,</text><text start="4072.3" dur="1">notwithstanding what they say.</text><text start="4073.3" dur="1">The basic reason is, &amp;quot;If others are very ugly,
then I am</text><text start="4074.3" dur="1">beautiful.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4075.3" dur="1">They are following Albert Einstein&amp;#39;s theory
of relativity.</text><text start="4076.3" dur="1">I have heard: Mulla Nasruddin was staying
in a hotel.</text><text start="4077.3" dur="1">A telegram had arrived from home
and he was in a hurry to catch the train.</text><text start="4078.3" dur="1">He rushed.</text><text start="4079.3" dur="1">But when he reached downstairs and
looked at his luggage the umbrella was missing.</text><text start="4080.3" dur="1">He had to go up to the room again and
by the time he reached the fourteenth floor</text><text start="4081.3" dur="1">the room had already been given to somebody
else -- a newlywed couple.</text><text start="4082.3" dur="1">Although he was in a hurry and he might miss
the train if he lingered there a little longer,</text><text start="4083.3" dur="1">the temptation was great.</text><text start="4084.3" dur="1">So he looked through the keyhole to see what
was happening.</text><text start="4085.3" dur="1">A newlywed couple -- they were also in a hurry,
they had already waited too long; the</text><text start="4086.3" dur="1">marriage ceremony and the church and the guests
and all that -- somehow they had got</text><text start="4087.3" dur="1">rid of all of them and they were lying naked
on the bed, talking sweet nothings.</text><text start="4088.3" dur="1">And the
young man was saying to the woman, &amp;quot;You have</text><text start="4089.3" dur="1">such beautiful eyes.</text><text start="4090.3" dur="1">I have never seen
such beautiful eyes!</text><text start="4091.3" dur="1">To whom do these eyes belong?&amp;quot;</text><text start="4092.3" dur="1">And the woman said, &amp;quot;To you!</text><text start="4093.3" dur="1">To you, and only to you!&amp;quot;</text><text start="4094.3" dur="1">And so on, the list went on.</text><text start="4095.3" dur="1">&amp;quot;These beautiful hands, these beautiful breasts,&amp;quot;
and this and</text><text start="4096.3" dur="1">that -- this went on and on.</text><text start="4097.3" dur="1">And Mulla had completely forgotten about the
train and the</text><text start="4098.3" dur="1">taxi waiting downstairs.</text><text start="4099.3" dur="1">But then suddenly he remembered his umbrella.</text><text start="4100.3" dur="1">When the list
was about to be completed, he said, &amp;quot;Wait!</text><text start="4101.3" dur="1">When you come to the yellow umbrella, that
belongs to me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4102.3" dur="1">People are unconsciously doing many things.</text><text start="4103.3" dur="1">If they become conscious these things will
drop.</text><text start="4104.3" dur="1">Atisha says: Don&amp;#39;t ponder over others&amp;#39; defects,
it is none of your business.</text><text start="4105.3" dur="1">Don&amp;#39;t
interfere in others&amp;#39; lives, it is none of</text><text start="4106.3" dur="1">your business.</text><text start="4107.3" dur="1">But there are great moralists whose whole
work is to see who is doing wrong.</text><text start="4108.3" dur="1">Their
whole life is wasted; they are like police</text><text start="4109.3" dur="1">dogs sniffing here and there.</text><text start="4110.3" dur="1">Their whole life&amp;#39;s
work is to know who is doing wrong.</text><text start="4111.3" dur="1">Atisha says: That is an ugly trait and a sheer
wastage of time and energy.</text><text start="4112.3" dur="1">Not only is it a
wastage but it strengthens and gratifies the</text><text start="4113.3" dur="1">ego.</text><text start="4114.3" dur="1">And an ego more gratified becomes more
of a barrier.</text><text start="4115.3" dur="1">And remember, it is not only a question of
not discussing others&amp;#39; defects.</text><text start="4116.3" dur="1">Don&amp;#39;t even be
too much concerned about your own defects.</text><text start="4117.3" dur="1">Take note, be aware, and let the matter be
settled then and there.</text><text start="4118.3" dur="1">There are a few other people who brag about
their own defects....</text><text start="4119.3" dur="1">It is suspected by psychologists that Saint
Augustine&amp;#39;s autobiography, his confessions,</text><text start="4120.3" dur="1">are
not true.</text><text start="4121.3" dur="1">He bragged about his defects.</text><text start="4122.3" dur="1">He was not that bad a person.</text><text start="4123.3" dur="1">But man is really
unbelievable.</text><text start="4124.3" dur="1">If you start bragging about your qualities,
then too, you go to extremes.</text><text start="4125.3" dur="1">If
you start bragging about sins, then too, you</text><text start="4126.3" dur="1">go to the extreme.</text><text start="4127.3" dur="1">But in both ways you do
only one thing.</text><text start="4128.3" dur="1">What Saint Augustine is doing is simple.</text><text start="4129.3" dur="1">By bragging about his defects and sins and
all</text><text start="4130.3" dur="1">kinds of ugly things, he is preparing a context.</text><text start="4131.3" dur="1">Out of such a hell he rose and became a
great saint.</text><text start="4132.3" dur="1">Now his saintliness looks far more significant
than it would have looked if he</text><text start="4133.3" dur="1">had been simply a good person from the very
beginning.</text><text start="4134.3" dur="1">And the same is the case with Mahatma Gandhi
in India.</text><text start="4135.3" dur="1">In his autobiography he simply
exaggerates about his defects and goes on</text><text start="4136.3" dur="1">talking about them.</text><text start="4137.3" dur="1">It helps him in a very
vicarious way.</text><text start="4138.3" dur="1">He was so low, he was in such a seventh hell,
and from there he started</text><text start="4139.3" dur="1">rising and became a great mahatma, a great
saint.</text><text start="4140.3" dur="1">The journey was very arduous.</text><text start="4141.3" dur="1">This is
very ego-fulfilling.</text><text start="4142.3" dur="1">Don&amp;#39;t discuss others&amp;#39; defects, don&amp;#39;t discuss
your own defects.</text><text start="4143.3" dur="1">Take note, and that is that.</text><text start="4144.3" dur="1">Atisha says awareness is enough, nothing else
is needed.</text><text start="4145.3" dur="1">If you are fully aware of
anything, the fire of awareness burns it.</text><text start="4146.3" dur="1">There is no need for any other remedy.</text><text start="4147.3" dur="1">DON&amp;#39;T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CONCERNS OTHERS.</text><text start="4148.3" dur="1">And that&amp;#39;s what you go on thinking.</text><text start="4149.3" dur="1">Ninety-nine percent of the things that you
think</text><text start="4150.3" dur="1">about concern others.</text><text start="4151.3" dur="1">Drop them -- drop them immediately!</text><text start="4152.3" dur="1">Your life is short, and your life is slipping
out of your fingers.</text><text start="4153.3" dur="1">Each moment you are less,
each day you are less, and each day you are</text><text start="4154.3" dur="1">less alive and more dead!</text><text start="4155.3" dur="1">Each birthday is a
death day; one more year is gone from your</text><text start="4156.3" dur="1">hands.</text><text start="4157.3" dur="1">Be a little more intelligent.</text><text start="4158.3" dur="1">DO NOT THINK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CONCERNS
OTHERS.</text><text start="4159.3" dur="1">TRAIN FIRST
AGAINST THE DEFILEMENT THAT IS GREATEST.</text><text start="4160.3" dur="1">Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples -- the
first thing, the very very first thing, &amp;quot;Find</text><text start="4161.3" dur="1">out
what your greatest characteristic is, your</text><text start="4162.3" dur="1">greatest undoing, your central characteristic
of</text><text start="4163.3" dur="1">unconsciousness.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4164.3" dur="1">Each one&amp;#39;s is different.</text><text start="4165.3" dur="1">Somebody is sex-obsessed.</text><text start="4166.3" dur="1">In a country like India, where for centuries
sex has been</text><text start="4167.3" dur="1">repressed, that has become almost a universal
characteristic; everybody is obsessed with</text><text start="4168.3" dur="1">sex.</text><text start="4169.3" dur="1">Somebody is obsessed with anger, and somebody
else is obsessed with greed.</text><text start="4170.3" dur="1">You
have to watch which is your basic obsession.</text><text start="4171.3" dur="1">So first find the main characteristic upon
which your whole ego edifice rests.</text><text start="4172.3" dur="1">And then be
constantly aware of it, because it can exist</text><text start="4173.3" dur="1">only if you are unaware.</text><text start="4174.3" dur="1">It is burnt in the fire
of awareness automatically.</text><text start="4175.3" dur="1">And remember, remember always, that you are
not to cultivate the opposite of it.</text><text start="4176.3" dur="1">Otherwise, what happens is a person becomes
aware that &amp;quot;My obsession is anger, so what</text><text start="4177.3" dur="1">should I do?</text><text start="4178.3" dur="1">I should cultivate compassion.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4179.3" dur="1">&amp;quot;My obsession is sex, so what should I do?</text><text start="4180.3" dur="1">I
should practice brahmacharya, celibacy.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4181.3" dur="1">People move from one thing to the opposite.</text><text start="4182.3" dur="1">That is not the way of transformation.</text><text start="4183.3" dur="1">It is
the same pendulum, moving from left to right,</text><text start="4184.3" dur="1">from right to left.</text><text start="4185.3" dur="1">And that&amp;#39;s how your life
has been moving for centuries; it is the same</text><text start="4186.3" dur="1">pendulum.</text><text start="4187.3" dur="1">The pendulum has to be stopped in the middle.</text><text start="4188.3" dur="1">And that&amp;#39;s the miracle of awareness.</text><text start="4189.3" dur="1">Just
be aware that &amp;quot;This is my chief pitfall, this</text><text start="4190.3" dur="1">is the place where I stumble again and again,
this is the root of my unconsciousness.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4191.3" dur="1">Don&amp;#39;t try to cultivate the opposite of it,
but pour</text><text start="4192.3" dur="1">your whole awareness into it.</text><text start="4193.3" dur="1">Create a great bonfire of awareness, and it
will be burned.</text><text start="4194.3" dur="1">And then the pendulum stops in the middle.</text><text start="4195.3" dur="1">And with the stopping of the pendulum, time
stops.</text><text start="4196.3" dur="1">You suddenly enter into the world of
timelessness, deathlessness, eternity.</text><text start="4197.3" dur="1">And the last sutra:
ABANDON ALL HOPES OF RESULTS.</text><text start="4198.3" dur="1">The ego is result-oriented, the mind always
hankers for results.</text><text start="4199.3" dur="1">The mind is never
interested in the act itself, its interest</text><text start="4200.3" dur="1">is in the result.</text><text start="4201.3" dur="1">&amp;quot;What am I going to gain out of it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="4202.3" dur="1">If the mind can manage to gain, without going
through any action, then it will choose the</text><text start="4203.3" dur="1">shortcut.</text><text start="4204.3" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s why educated people become very cunning,
because they are able to find shortcuts.</text><text start="4205.3" dur="1">If you earn money through a legal way, it
may take your whole life.</text><text start="4206.3" dur="1">But you can earn
money by smuggling, by gambling or by something</text><text start="4207.3" dur="1">else -- by becoming a political
leader, a prime minister, a president -- then</text><text start="4208.3" dur="1">you have all the shortcuts available to you.</text><text start="4209.3" dur="1">The educated person becomes cunning.</text><text start="4210.3" dur="1">He does not become wise, he simply becomes
clever.</text><text start="4211.3" dur="1">He becomes so cunning that he wants to have
everything without doing anything</text><text start="4212.3" dur="1">for it.</text><text start="4213.3" dur="1">The mind, the ego, are all result-oriented.</text><text start="4214.3" dur="1">The being is not result-oriented.</text><text start="4215.3" dur="1">And how can
the non-being ever be result-oriented?</text><text start="4216.3" dur="1">It is not there at all in the first place.</text><text start="4217.3" dur="1">Meditation happens only to those who are not
result-oriented.</text><text start="4218.3" dur="1">There is an ancient story:
A man was very much interested in self-knowledge,</text><text start="4219.3" dur="1">in self-realization.</text><text start="4220.3" dur="1">His whole search
had been to find a master who could teach</text><text start="4221.3" dur="1">him meditation.</text><text start="4222.3" dur="1">He went from one master to
another, but nothing was happening.</text><text start="4223.3" dur="1">Years went by, he was tired, exhausted.</text><text start="4224.3" dur="1">Then someone told him, &amp;quot;If you really want
to</text><text start="4225.3" dur="1">find a master you will have to go to the Himalayas.</text><text start="4226.3" dur="1">He lives in some unknown parts of
the Himalayas; you will have to search for</text><text start="4227.3" dur="1">him.</text><text start="4228.3" dur="1">One thing is certain, he is there.</text><text start="4229.3" dur="1">Nobody
knows exactly where, because whenever somebody</text><text start="4230.3" dur="1">comes to know of him he moves
from that place and goes even deeper into</text><text start="4231.3" dur="1">the Himalayan ranges.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4232.3" dur="1">The man was getting old, but he gathered courage.</text><text start="4233.3" dur="1">For two years he had to work to earn
money for the journey, then he made the journey.</text><text start="4234.3" dur="1">It is an old story.</text><text start="4235.3" dur="1">He had to ride on
camels and horses and then go on foot, and</text><text start="4236.3" dur="1">then he reached the Himalayas.</text><text start="4237.3" dur="1">People said,
&amp;quot;Yes, we have heard about the old man, very</text><text start="4238.3" dur="1">ancient he is, one cannot say how old --
maybe three hundred years old, or even five</text><text start="4239.3" dur="1">hundred years old; nobody knows.</text><text start="4240.3" dur="1">He lives
somewhere, but the location cannot be given</text><text start="4241.3" dur="1">to you.</text><text start="4242.3" dur="1">Nobody is aware of where exactly
you will find him, but he is there.</text><text start="4243.3" dur="1">If you search hard you are bound to find him.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4244.3" dur="1">The man searched and searched and searched.</text><text start="4245.3" dur="1">For two years he was roaming in the
Himalayas -- tired, exhausted, dead exhausted,</text><text start="4246.3" dur="1">living only on wild fruits, leaves and
grass.</text><text start="4247.3" dur="1">He had lost much weight.</text><text start="4248.3" dur="1">But he was intent that he had to find this
man; even if it</text><text start="4249.3" dur="1">took his life, it would be worth it.</text><text start="4250.3" dur="1">And can you imagine?</text><text start="4251.3" dur="1">One day he saw a small hut, a grass hut.</text><text start="4252.3" dur="1">He was so tired that he
was not even able to walk, so he crawled.</text><text start="4253.3" dur="1">He reached the hut.</text><text start="4254.3" dur="1">There was no door; he
looked in, there was nobody inside.</text><text start="4255.3" dur="1">And not only was there nobody inside, but
there was</text><text start="4256.3" dur="1">every sign that for years there had been nobody
inside.</text><text start="4257.3" dur="1">You can think what would have happened to
that man.</text><text start="4258.3" dur="1">He fell on the ground.</text><text start="4259.3" dur="1">Out of
sheer tiredness he said, &amp;quot;I give up.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4260.3" dur="1">He was lying there under the sun in the cool
breeze of</text><text start="4261.3" dur="1">the Himalayas, and for the first time he started
feeling so blissful, he had never tasted</text><text start="4262.3" dur="1">such bliss!</text><text start="4263.3" dur="1">Suddenly he started feeling full of light.</text><text start="4264.3" dur="1">Suddenly all thoughts disappeared,
suddenly he was transported -- and for no</text><text start="4265.3" dur="1">reason at all, because he had not done anything.</text><text start="4266.3" dur="1">And then he became aware that somebody was
leaning over him.</text><text start="4267.3" dur="1">He opened his eyes.</text><text start="4268.3" dur="1">A
very ancient man was there.</text><text start="4269.3" dur="1">And the old man, smiling, said, &amp;quot;So you have
come.</text><text start="4270.3" dur="1">Have
you something to ask me?&amp;quot;</text><text start="4271.3" dur="1">And the man said, &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4272.3" dur="1">And the old man laughed, a great belly laugh
which was echoed by the valleys.</text><text start="4273.3" dur="1">And he
said, &amp;quot;So now you know what meditation is?&amp;quot;</text><text start="4274.3" dur="1">And the man said, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4275.3" dur="1">What had happened?</text><text start="4276.3" dur="1">That assertion which came from his deepest
core of being -- &amp;quot;I give</text><text start="4277.3" dur="1">up&amp;quot; -- in that very giving up, all goal-oriented
mind efforts and endeavors disappeared.</text><text start="4278.3" dur="1">&amp;quot;I
give up.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4279.3" dur="1">In that very moment he was no more the same
person.</text><text start="4280.3" dur="1">And bliss showered on
him.</text><text start="4281.3" dur="1">He was silent, he was a nobody, and he touched
the ultimate stratum of non-being.</text><text start="4282.3" dur="1">Then he knew what meditation is.</text><text start="4283.3" dur="1">Meditation is a non-goal-oriented state of
mind.</text><text start="4284.3" dur="1">This last sutra is tremendously significant:
ABANDON ALL HOPES OF RESULTS.</text><text start="4285.3" dur="1">And then there is no need to go anywhere,
God will come to you.</text><text start="4286.3" dur="1">Deep down say, &amp;quot;I give
up.&amp;quot;</text><text start="4287.3" dur="1">And silence descends, benediction showers.</text><text start="4288.3" dur="1">Meditate over these sutras, they are meant
only for meditators.</text><text start="4289.3" dur="1">Atisha is not a
philosopher, he is a siddha, a buddha.</text><text start="4290.3" dur="1">What he is saying is not some speculation.</text><text start="4291.3" dur="1">These
are clear-cut instructions given only to those</text><text start="4292.3" dur="1">who are ready to travel, to go on the
pilgrimage into the unknown.</text><text start="4293.3" dur="0.003">Enough for today.</text></transcript>
